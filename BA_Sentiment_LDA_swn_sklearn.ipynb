      "**John Woolford**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me on today‚Äôs call are\n",
      "Armando Anido, chief executive officer; and Keith Goldan, vice president and\n",
      "chief financial officer. Terri Sebree, president; and Jerry McLaughlin, chief\n",
      "commercial officer, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "We issued a press release detailing third quarter 2012 financial results this\n",
      "morning. For those of you who may not have seen the release, it is available\n",
      "on our website at www.nupathe.com, in the Investor Relations section.\n",
      "\n",
      "The format of today's call is as follows. Armando will begin with an overview\n",
      "of recent corporate highlights. Keith will then provide a summary of our\n",
      "financial results for the quarter, and Armando will end the prepared remarks\n",
      "with a brief closing, followed by a Q&A session.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that we will make various remarks\n",
      "during this conference call that constitute forward-looking statements. All\n",
      "remarks that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking\n",
      "statements and include, among others, statements regarding our ability to\n",
      "obtain FDA approval and commercial partners for Zecuity and the timing of such\n",
      "events, potential benefits and commercial prospects of Zecuity, sufficiency of\n",
      "our cash to fund debt service and interest obligations and continue operations\n",
      "into the fourth quarter, and our plans, objectives, expectations, and beliefs\n",
      "regarding future operations, performance, financial conditions, and other\n",
      "future events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, and\n",
      "assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely\n",
      "from those reflected in the statements, including those factors discussed\n",
      "under the heading of Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December\n",
      "31, 2011, which is on file with the SEC and available through the Investor\n",
      "Relations section of our corporate website.\n",

      "the company specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. Also, today's call\n",
      "may not be reproduced in any form without our expressed written consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will now turn the call over to Armando Anido, Chief Executive Officer.\n",
      "Armando?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Armando Anido**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Over the last\n",
      "few months, we have made significant progress. On our last call, I outlined\n",
      "four key priorities for the next 12 months that are designed to increase\n",
      "shareholder value.\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost was to secure the necessary financial resources to achieve\n",
      "these objectives. In October, we completed a $28 million sale of securities.\n",
      "The securities were sold as units, each consisting of 1/1000 of a share of\n",
      "newly designated series A preferred stock, and a warrant to purchase one share\n",
      "of common stock. The purchase price per unit was $2.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conjunction with the financing, we restructured our outstanding debt, and\n",
      "undertook cost containment measures to further extend our cash runway. The\n",
      "cost containment measures included a reduction in workforce, a reduction of\n",
      "expenditures relating to commercialization activities for Zecuity, and a delay\n",
      "in the filing of an IND application for MP202 until a codevelopment partner is\n",
      "obtained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collectively, these actions served to focus the company on the most important\n",
      "objectives for creating shareholder value: obtaining FDA approval for Zecuity,\n",
      "securing commercial partners, and conducting additional prelaunch activities.\n",
      "All told, we now have the financial resources to achieve these objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going forward, our first priority is to work closely with the FDA to obtain\n",
      "approval of Zecuity. Our team did an outstanding job addressing the questions\n",
      "contained in the FDA‚Äôs complete response letter, and during the quarter our\n",
      "NDA was accepted by the FDA with a PDUFA date of January 17, 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have had regular interactions with the FDA since filing, and remain\n",
      "confident in the approval of Zecuity. As I stated last quarter, we believe the\n",
      "product enhancements we made before resubmitting the NDA have resulted in an\n",
      "even more compelling product for migraine sufferers. Just as importantly, we\n",
      "are actively pursuing U.S. and rest-of-world commercial partners for Zecuity.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the first and only migraine patch, Zecuity is uniquely positioned to\n",
      "address the significant unmet disease burden of migraine-related nausea and\n",
      "vomiting, and is an attractive, specialist-driven, near-term commercial\n",
      "opportunity. We believe the game-changing disruptive technology employed by\n",
      "Zecuity will provide it with a long patent protection. We expect that a\n",
      "partnership will occur after FDA approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our other priority is to conduct additional prelaunch activities that build\n",
      "upon the extensive launch preparations we have completed over the past two\n",
      "years. We believe the patch has the opportunity to change the treatment\n",
      "landscape for migraine, by making a tolerable, non-oral triptan therapy\n",
      "available to the over eight million patients who frequently experience\n",
      "migraine-related nausea and vomiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our confidence stems from 1) our continued dialogue with our scientific\n",
      "advisors, 2) recent data from a landmark study pointing to the significant\n",
      "disease burden associated with migraine-related nausea and vomiting, both in\n",
      "decreased patient satisfaction and markedly higher healthcare costs, and 3)\n",
      "the consistent feedback from our physician and patient research that Zecuity\n",
      "is uniquely positioned to address both headache pain and migraine-related\n",
      "nausea and vomiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we progress toward an approval for Zecuity, we are well-prepared for\n",
      "commercialization. This includes market research with well over 700\n",
      "physicians, more than 800 patients, and pharmacy and medical directors from\n",
      "insurance companies accounting for more than 130 million covered lives in the\n",
      "United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have built a detailed field sales launch plan, including completion of\n",
      "physician targeting, sales territory identification, and a sophisticated\n",
      "geotargeting model that will allow us to optimize our marketing dollars by\n",
      "geographic location. We have a managed care strategy to obtain reimbursement,\n",
      "but it‚Äôs highly consistent with our brand strategy and product positioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we have constructed and are ready to implement our commercial\n",
      "operations infrastructure, in which we are leveraging the latest technologies\n",
      "to operate efficiently with seamless integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our marketing efforts, we have finalized our branding and have a clear and\n",
      "well-defined product positioning and messaging platform focused on migraine-\n",
      "related nausea and vomiting that is impactful and well-differentiated from all\n",
      "available and developing migraine treatment options.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example of our ongoing initiatives, later this week we will participate\n",
      "in the American Headache Society Scottsdale Headache Symposium. We will\n",
      "conduct an advisory board with many of the thought leaders in headache, and\n",
      "host a scientific affairs exhibit booth where symposium participants can\n",
      "interact with our R&D leadership team.\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm also excited to share that the Zecuity Phase III pivotal placebo-\n",
      "controlled trial was just published in the October edition of Headache, the\n",
      "premier journal for headache specialists in the United States. The publication\n",
      "highlights that Zecuity rapidly relieved both headache pain and migraine-\n",
      "related nausea within one hour, with a very low incidence of triptan\n",
      "sensations. As a result, this trial serves as the basis of the Zecuity NDA.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see, we‚Äôve been quite busy focusing on our key objectives. At this\n",
      "point, I‚Äôd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Keith Goldan, to review our\n",
      "financial results. Keith?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Keith Goldan**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Armando, and good morning everyone. We filed our form 10-Q on\n",
      "Friday afternoon, and issued a press release detailing financial results for\n",
      "the third quarter 2012 earlier this morning. NuPathe reported a net loss of\n",
      "$6.2 million, for the third quarter of 2012, compared with a net loss of $7.3\n",
      "million for the third quarter of 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the third consecutive quarter, operating expenses totaled just under $6\n",
      "million, while clinical and regulatory expenses were lower in this most recent\n",
      "quarter, due to the resubmission of the Zecuity NDA in July. This decrease was\n",
      "offset by accruals for severance costs related to the separation of our former\n",
      "CEO in July, as well as the reduction in force in September. As we recorded\n",
      "all of these related severance costs in the third quarter, we expect to begin\n",
      "to recognize the benefit of lower operating expenses beginning in Q4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research and development expenses were $2.2 million in the third quarter of\n",
      "2012, compared with $3.9 million in the comparable quarter of 2011. The\n",
      "decrease was largely attributable to reduced spending related to Zecuity,\n",
      "NP201, and NP202 during the 2012 period, combined with the fact that the 2011\n",
      "period included higher CMC expenses related to the purchase and manufacture of\n",
      "clinical supplies for Zecuity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $3.5 million in the third\n",
      "quarter of this year, compared with $3.0 million spent during the same period\n",
      "last year. The increase in 2012 can be attributed to separation expenses\n",
      "accrued in Q3 as I mentioned earlier, partially offset by reduced activities\n",
      "in commercial operations during the third quarter of 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30,\n",
      "2012 was $15.1 million, primarily as a result of spending for normal operating\n",
      "activities, costs incurred for the resubmission of the Zecuity NDA, as well as\n",
      "other expenditures for the continued development of Zecuity. During that same\n",
      "period, we also used $0.3 million of cash in investing activities and $6.4\n",
      "million of cash for financing activities related to contractual debt\n",
      "repayments.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of September 30, 2012, NuPathe had $1.3 million in cash and equivalents,\n",
      "and a working capital deficit of $7.6 million, compared with $7.5 million in\n",
      "cash and equivalents and a working capital deficit of $4.9 million at June 30,\n",
      "2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Armando mentioned earlier, in October, subsequent to the end of the\n",
      "quarter, we raised $28 million in gross proceeds from a security offering.\n",
      "That financing resulted in net proceeds of $26.3 million, and we now expect\n",
      "our existing cash and equivalents to be sufficient to fund operations, debt\n",
      "service, and interest obligations into the fourth quarter of 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôll now turn the call back over to Armando for closing remarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Armando Anido**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Keith. In conjunction with the financing, we also made some changes to\n",
      "our board. Jim Datin, executive vice president and managing director, and\n",
      "Brian Sisko, senior vice president and general counsel, both from Safeguard\n",
      "Scientifics, as well as Richard Kollender, our partner at Quaker Partners,\n",
      "were appointed to our board of directors on October 23, 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Jeanne Cunicelli, investment partner at Bay City Capital,\n",
      "and Dr. Gary Kurtzman, senior vice president and managing director at\n",
      "Safeguard, both resigned from the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are pleased to welcome Jim, Brian, and Richard to our board. Given their\n",
      "backgrounds and expertise, we expect them to contribute significantly to our\n",
      "future success. I‚Äôd also like to take this opportunity to thank both Gene and\n",
      "Gary for their valuable contributions and dedication to the company over the\n",
      "past six years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, it‚Äôs been quite a successful last few months for NuPathe. We realized\n",
      "two important achievements. The company received FDA acceptance of our NDA for\n",
      "Zecuity, and we strengthened our balance sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "These achievements leave us well-positioned to focus on our key objectives:\n",
      "obtaining FDA approval for Zecuity, securing commercial partners, and\n",
      "conducting additional pre-launch activities. We look forward to the January 17\n",
      "PDUFA date, and remain confident in both the approval and commercial prospects\n",
      "for Zecuity. We again thank all of our stakeholders for their continued\n",
      "support.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, we‚Äôre now happy to take questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A\n",
      "session.\n",

      "IPO financing was down 74% in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third\n",

      "According to the World Federation of Exchanges, together Toronto Stock\n",

      "market clearly welcomed these transactions. However, the number of financing\n",
      "transactions, which is an important revenue driver for us, continues to be\n",
      "behind 2011 levels. The number of financings was 8% lower in the third quarter\n",

      "Finally, I want to be sure you‚Äôre aware that the Toronto Stock Exchange\n",

      "reflecting lower revenue from issuer services, cash markets trading,\n",

      "Europe and rest of world enjoyed higher after-market sales and industrial\n",
      "Americas continued to see strong revenue, up 8.5% excluding lower lead-based\n",
      "pricing. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation,\n",
      "second quarter gross profit was lower than the comparable prior year period by\n",
      "approximately $15 million. Of this amount, the Americas region was negatively\n",
      "impacted by approximately $18 million, a result of continued high core costs\n",
      "and lower LME-based pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operating income declined versus the prior year period primarily as the result\n",
      "of higher core costs, compressed margins on third party lead sales, and much\n",
      "lower LME-based lead prices. Net loss for the current quarter was 13.9 million\n",
      "or $0.18 per share compared to a prior year period net loss of $3.6 million or\n",
      "$0.05 per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please turn to Slide 5. Our year-to-date U.S. lead production was\n",
      "approximately 164,000 tons, down about 2.5% from the prior year period. As the\n",
      "pie chart indicates, 78% was used to satisfy internal demand. External lead\n",
      "sales decreased about 4,600 tons compared to the first half of fiscal 2012 as\n",
      "we began to phase out this volatile revenue stream. Higher core costs\n",
      "negatively impacted third party lead sales during the quarter, resulting in\n",
      "significantly lower profits as these sales of (inaudible) sales as compared to\n",
      "the prior year.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the quarter, the average cost of purchased spent batteries as a percent\n",
      "of LME remained at record levels. Core supply in October was much improved and\n",
      "we have seen a corresponding softening in price while lead on the LME has\n",
      "increased slightly. If these factors would remain at these levels or improve\n",
      "further, operating income would benefit, everything else being equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We remain focused on improving our collection of spent batteries at more\n",
      "economical levels. Our captive core return volume is up 14% sequentially over\n",
      "the first quarter. Additionally as we reduce our transportation OE volume and\n",
      "our third party lead sales, our captive core rate should be further improved\n",
      "due to this customer mix change.\n",

      "Turning to Slide 6, I‚Äôd like to review our operating segments. Industrial\n",
      "Energy Americas net sales, excluding the lead-related pricing, was up about\n",
      "8.5% in the current quarter as compared to the prior year second quarter. The\n",
      "margin impact of stronger sales, however, was more than offset by $6 million\n",
      "of reduced lead margin, the result of historically high lead of spent\n",
      "batteries compared with lower LME-based price reductions. Expected price\n",
      "increases did not materialize as competition backed off previously announced\n",
      "price actions. Industrial Energy Europe and rest of world reported an\n",
      "approximate 2% increase in net sales excluding lower lead pricing and\n",
      "unfavorable currency translation. Operating margin held steady in the quarter.\n",
      "Our European business reported higher operating income for the second straight\n",

      "pressures from local producers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transportation Americas net sales, excluding unfavorable lead-related pricing,\n",
      "decreased about 2% compared to the prior year second quarter. Both gross\n",
      "margin and operating margin were down as compared to the prior year period\n",
      "primarily due to lower aftermarket unit sales and continued higher cost of\n",
      "cores combined with lower LME-based lead pricing. Third party lead sales\n",
      "accounted for about $4.5 million of the reduced gross profit in the current\n",
      "quarter. Transportation Europe and rest of world net sales, excluding foreign\n",
      "currency translation and lead-related pricing, were flat in the fiscal ‚Äô13\n",
      "second quarter versus the prior year period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gross margin and operating income declined as a result of lower carryover\n",
      "pricing implemented in the second half of fiscal 2012, as well as an\n",
      "escalation of core costs as a percent of LME. Although not as dramatic as\n",
      "we‚Äôve seen across the Americas, the cost of spent batteries has been rising in\n",
      "Europe. Such cost increases are beginning to result in higher premiums paid\n",
      "for lead. We expect these increases to be passed through in the form of\n",
      "escalators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please turn to Slide 7 for an update of our liquidity position. At September\n",
      "30, 2012, we had total liquidity of $211 million versus $228 million at\n",
      "September 30, 2011. The current year includes $74 million in cash and\n",
      "approximately $135 million under the revolving credit facility. As is\n",
      "typically the case, to meet seasonal demands we added inventory in the period,\n",
      "albeit at a lower rate than in the prior year comparable quarter. We used $99\n",
      "million of free cash flow in the first half compared to a use of $87 million\n",
      "in the prior year period. Consistent with the prior year, we expect third\n",

      "Thanks, Phil. As Phil mentioned earlier, my comments are focused on key\n",
      "strategic issues and actions for each business for both the near and long-\n",
      "term. Let me begin with a focus on our Americas region. Slide 8 is summary\n",
      "view of the important issues facing our Americas business. We‚Äôre disappointed\n",
      "with the quarter and year-to-date results for the Americas segment. This\n",
      "business has been faced with a rapidly changing economic environment and we\n",
      "are aggressively adapting the business to deal with these new external\n",
      "realities. This involved continuing to execute the strategic actions we have\n",
      "already announced plus accelerating new initiatives. I‚Äôll cover the actions we\n",
      "have in place to address these issues during the next few slides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please turn to Slide 9. As we‚Äôve discussed in the past, our Americas\n",
      "transportation business has carried approximately one plant of excess capacity\n",
      "for quite some time. About a year ago, we announced the planned shutdown of\n",
      "our Bristol, Tennessee flooded battery plant to right-size our transportation\n",
      "capacity. We have been executing on this initiative since then and continue to\n",
      "be on schedule to transfer all flooded battery assembly from Bristol to\n",
      "Salina, Kansas and Manchester, Iowa by the end of our fiscal third quarter.\n",
      "I‚Äôm pleased to report that we are on track with certification from our OE\n",
      "customers, a key milestone for the transfer. Formation of the process to\n",
      "charge batteries will follow over the next three to six months as we complete\n",
      "installation of new state-of-the-art formation equipment in the receiving\n",
      "plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the complete closure of Bristol, we expect to have two plants at\n",
      "substantially full capacity. As consistently stated, we anticipate an annual\n",
      "improvement of 20 to $25 million in operating income as a result of this\n",
      "initiative. A portion of this will be realized as early as this fiscal fourth\n",
      "quarter with an anticipated full run rate beginning in the early part of\n",
      "fiscal 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to Slide 10, I‚Äôll brief you on our lead recycling capacity situation\n",
      "and the revised strategy relating to our North American lead supply chain.\n",
      "Approximately 400,000 metric tons of recycling capacity will have been added\n",
      "to the North American market by 2013. Core supply and product demand have not\n",
      "kept pace. This imbalance has likely contributed to high spent battery costs.\n",
      "While we still believe that our recycling assets continue to offer us a\n",
      "competitive advantage, we believe in this environment it is no longer prudent\n",
      "to maintain capacity in excess of our internal needs. Some of the excess\n",
      "capacity was historically sold profitably at LME-based prices to third\n",
      "parties. As core costs have increased and LME has declined, profit from this\n",
      "business has been reduced and become quite volatile.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to our previously announced transaction with respect to our\n",
      "Frisco, Texas recycling operation, we have decided to idle lead production in\n",
      "our Reading, Pennsylvania plant. As shown on the chart, we will reduce our\n",
      "capacity by roughly 150,000 tons by these actions. As a result, we are exiting\n",
      "third party lead sales and will now procure 25% of our lead needs from\n",
      "external tolling and primary lead suppliers. This supply equation will offer\n",
      "us more much flexibility to optimize supply sources and freight logistics as\n",
      "conditions change.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we believe taking this combined capacity offline should relieve some of\n",
      "the pressure on core costs, this was not the only reason for the decision. In\n",
      "addition, we will avoid capital spending of as much as $50 million that would\n",
      "have been required to bring Frisco and Reading into compliance with new\n",
      "regulatory air emission requirements. The Frisco closure remains on schedule\n",
      "and we continue to anticipate net proceeds of 35 to $38 million in mid-\n",
      "calendar 2013. We expect to cease production in Reading by the end of this\n",
      "fiscal year. Cash restructuring charges related to Reading are expected to be\n",
      "4 to $5 million and a charge related thereto will be recorded in our fiscal\n",
      "third quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with our Frisco workforce, we regret the impact this decision will have on\n",
      "our Reading-based employees. They are a dedicated group of employees and we\n",
      "will attempt to relocate those who have an interest and will work with state\n",
      "and local officials to support the remainder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please turn to Slide 11. As we have described on previous calls, the\n",
      "fundamental dynamics of lead recycling in North America have changed.\n",
      "Historically core prices and LME have been correlated; or said another way,\n",
      "the core price to LME ratio has been fairly constant. Over the last year, this\n",
      "ratio has trended much higher and become less predictable. As previously\n",
      "described by Phil, core cost in the Americas coupled with lower relative LME\n",
      "lead prices continue to pressure margins significantly - $38 million year-to-\n",
      "date. Clearly there has been a shortage of spent batteries and increased\n",
      "demand with the new smelting capacity I discussed previously.\n",
      "\n",
      "To adapt our business to this new market reality, we are exiting or reducing\n",
      "our exposure to customer segments without corresponding core returns, namely\n",
      "third party lead sales and automotive OE customers. Equally as important is to\n",
      "obtain a higher percentage of captive cores at less than market pricing. We‚Äôve\n",
      "taken a number of steps to address this and are seeing steady progress.\n",
      "Examples include utilizing our transportation branch network to focus on\n",
      "industrial captives, up 19% in Q2 versus Q1; achieving better transportation\n",
      "aftermarket customer mix with customers such as Pep Boys; and core collection\n",
      "programs through our branch locations with core purchases up 50% in Q2 over\n",
      "Q1. Results of these activities are promising. In particular, our return of\n",
      "spent industrial batteries in the month of October was at an all-time high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, we continue to negotiate with customers on pricing to better match our\n",
      "lead input costs. We already achieved agreement from certain key customers on\n",
      "escalators that consider both LME and core cost factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please turn to Slide 12 for a discussion on the Americas industrial business.\n",
      "As you are aware, industrial Americas has been our most profitable business.\n",
      "Although margins have been pressured this year due to lead, this business\n",
      "remains a significant opportunity for profitable growth. We remain excited\n",
      "about the continued adoption of our Tubular motor power products. To support\n",
      "increasing customer demand, we added a second line of Tubular capacity at our\n",
      "Kansas City plant, which is already operating at a high utilization level.\n",
      "Plans for a third line are under development and will be installed as demand\n",
      "dictates.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the recent AGM capacity coming online in Columbus, Georgia, we‚Äôre now\n",
      "positioned for further penetration in multiple industrial applications\n",
      "requiring basic AGM block batteries. We are under-represented in this product\n",
      "offering with market share of 6 to 7 points less than our overall share\n",
      "position. This incremental capacity will allow us to be more responsive with\n",
      "respect to product needs and faster lead times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, our position in South America has been on an import-only basis to\n",
      "date with mostly network power products. We are in the final stages of\n",
      "establishing a partnership arrangement which we believe will position us for\n",
      "further growth in industrial products in this region.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you turn to Slide 13, you‚Äôll see a summary of what we view as major issues\n",
      "for our European business. With the next few slides, I‚Äôll cover the strategies\n",
      "and actions we have identified to address these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please turn to Slide 14. The chart reflects our current view of the OM\n",
      "evolution to micro-hybrid batteries on a pan-European basis. This evolution\n",
      "will potentially present a pricing and margin challenge for traditional\n",
      "flooded batteries and a significant opportunity for those like us adding\n",
      "capacity to meet the emerging micro-hybrid market. As demand for flooded\n",
      "batteries diminishes we are taking aggressive cost reduction action to\n",
      "mitigate price and margin erosion. More importantly, we are executing a well-\n",
      "managed transition of flooded capacity to our MHF, or micro-hybrid flooded\n",
      "product, to take advantage of this technology shift. At our Manzanares, Spain\n",
      "plant, we are already transitioning from flooded to MHF by replacing 750,000\n",
      "units of flooded capacity with MHF production. We are substantially complete\n",
      "with our AGM capacity expansion in Romano, Italy and are well underway in\n",
      "terms of adding more than 1.5 million units of AGM capacity in Poznan, Poland.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are committed to continuing to invest in innovative solutions to meet our\n",
      "customers‚Äô evolving needs for these micro hybrid batteries. This will involve\n",
      "not only technology development but also focused project management to ensure\n",
      "customer approval (inaudible) this new capacity once online.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see on Slide 15, transportation battery growth rates in eastern\n",
      "Europe are expected to be significantly higher over the next several years\n",
      "than in western Europe. This ongoing shift in demand by geography is causing\n",
      "OEMs to move production east and they are encouraging their component\n",
      "suppliers to do likewise. Our Poznan, Poland plant will support some of this\n",
      "migration. To serve the CIS region and Russia, we have plans to expand our 75%\n",
      "owned joint venture in Pinsk, Belarus. The planned investment will allow us to\n",
      "meet demands of a major European OE as it expands car assembly into Russia.\n",
      "The Pinsk expansion will take place over the next 24 to 36 months, supporting\n",
      "CIS unit growth from roughly 500,000 in FY13 to approximately 1.5 million\n",
      "units in FY16.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Slide 16, I‚Äôll focus on our actions to improve profitability of our\n",
      "European industrial business. We‚Äôve had some success with pricing in certain\n",
      "targeted markets, but the vast majority of Europe remains very competitive.\n",
      "With the economy softening in many countries, we expect the market to remain\n",
      "in a competitive state. Driving profitability of the business continues to be\n",
      "a primary focus. Through the use of lean six sigma and VAV initiatives, we are\n",
      "seeing reduced product costs. At the same time, we are targeting capital\n",
      "spending to allow greater productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are nearing the completion of an extensive project in our Lille, France\n",
      "plant which will provide a more efficient production flow with reduced\n",
      "indirect cost. We will be committing resources to redesign and approve network\n",
      "power products, improving performance as well as extending the range of our\n",
      "offerings. In Motive Power, our Tensor product has completed several\n",
      "successful trials with many customers as we ramp production of this higher\n",
      "margin product. We are also finding good success driving solution sales with\n",
      "our more efficient high frequency chargers paired with Motive Power batteries.\n",
      "Our service platform is being revamped to allow it to become a profit\n",
      "generating activity. A reduction of our service technician population is\n",
      "already underway and we intend to make our workforce substantially more\n",
      "efficient using new automated service tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you‚Äôll turn to Slide 17, I‚Äôd like to recap our strategic focus for our\n",
      "businesses. Starting with transportation Americas, we will limit growth and\n",
      "continue to focus on return to profitability and cash generation. Limited\n",
      "capital spending is anticipated with earnings improvement resulting from the\n",
      "closure of Bristol, maximizing utilization of Salina and Manchester capacity,\n",
      "optimized lead supply chain, and ongoing productivity initiatives. With\n",
      "limited capacity, we will look to manage our customer portfolio for maximum\n",
      "return on investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "For transportation Europe, we are managing micro hybrid battery capacity ramp-\n",
      "up carefully with demand. This will involve bringing innovative technology to\n",
      "market for both advanced AGM and MHF solutions. We are carefully selecting the\n",
      "right opportunities to meet growing demand in the CIS region, the Middle East\n",
      "and North Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "For industrial Americas, we are re-deploying resources to allow this business\n",
      "to grow profitably at a faster rate. We have great products with more new\n",
      "offerings on the horizon. We‚Äôre in the process of adding more feet on the\n",
      "street, including sales and service personnel, utilizing our existing branch\n",
      "network. Additionally, we look to expand in South America via relatively small\n",
      "investments to gain local content to serve this growing market.\n",
      "\n",
      "In industrial Europe, we‚Äôll be unrelenting in executing margin improvement via\n",
      "pricing, new product introductions, and continued productivity initiatives. In\n",
      "addition, we are in the process of exiting our small industrial business in\n",
      "India as we focus on more attractive markets in Asia Pacific. Cash\n",
      "restructuring charges to this will be fairly significant and we are finalizing\n",
      "an impairment charge which will be recorded in our third quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please turn to Slide 18 for a brief summary and wrap-up. The fiscal 2013\n",
      "second quarter was significantly impacted by continued high core costs\n",
      "combined with lower LME lead-based pricing. However, as Phil mentioned this\n",
      "morning, we began to have more adequate supply of spent batteries in late\n",
      "September, and this has continued through October. We currently expect this\n",
      "trend to continue as we enter the fall and winter battery season.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to focus on improving profitability in all businesses, and the\n",
      "completion of several new initiatives is in the near future, specifically the\n",
      "closures of Frisco and Bristol and the idling of lead production in Reading.\n",
      "Our targeted growth plans and actions in transportation Europe and industrial\n",
      "Americas is underway and sets the stage for top line growth and improved\n",
      "financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today we mentioned several strategic changes in our business model and\n",

      "rate that we talked about a quarter ago, recognizing that volumes are going to\n",

      "might look like. Certainly scarcity of cores through this year has been an\n",

      "issues ‚Äì you have to have short cores in front of the smelters. What we are\n",

      "\n",
      "The major challenge obviously is the economy and the reduction in a number of\n",

      "Although the 10-K we filed last night is of course the annual report for the\n",
      "full fiscal year of 2008, I‚Äôm going to focus my remarks today on the fourth\n",
      "quarter results because that‚Äôs how we really measure our progress. The short\n",
      "story for the June quarter is, as Vince just said, we had a good quarter\n",
      "despite a poor economy. Now, fourth quarter revenue was $79.3 million compared\n",
      "to $82.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 08 and $98.6 in the fourth\n",
      "quarter last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue declined from 2007 because of our planned exit from uneconomic\n",
      "customer contracts acquired with the CD&L merger, the loss of a significant\n",
      "bank customer in the second quarter of 2008, continued migration of banking\n",
      "customers due to the Check 21 scanning technology, some volume declines from\n",
      "continuing customers due to the slowing US economy and you heard Vince mention\n",
      "that as well. Then, what we will refer to as unplanned customer service stops.\n",
      "\n",
      "These changes were partly offset by new revenue from customer start ups of\n",
      "$7.5 million and $2.5 million of volume growth from other continuing customers\n",
      "that are less affected by the slowing US economy, primarily customers in the\n",
      "healthcare area. If we compare revenue to the March quarter it‚Äôs down $2.9\n",
      "million, a third of that is getting out of uneconomic contracts. Over half of\n",
      "it is volume declines from continuing customers because of the slow economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is another $2.5 million that is unplanned customer service stops but\n",
      "then $2.5 million of new customer starts benefitting revenue in the June\n",
      "quarter. That level of unplanned service stops continues to trend down. That‚Äôs\n",
      "just one more indication that the integration of the driver forces and the\n",
      "databases that we use to manage them are now behind us. In fact, these\n",
      "unplanned service stops in the first three months of fiscal 2009 are down to a\n",
      "quarterly rate of $1.5 million, better actually than where Velocity was before\n",
      "the merger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to gross profit, our gross profit before depreciation for the quarter\n",
      "was $22.8 million, that‚Äôs 28.7% of sales, a little bit better than we had\n",
      "projected it was going to be when we were on this conference call back in May.\n",
      "That compares to $20.9 million or 25.4% of sales in the March quarter and\n",
      "26.9% of sales for the June quarter a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "That year-over-year change reflects a 330 basis point improvement in driver\n",
      "pay margin which was partially offset by the absence of a non-cash benefit\n",
      "last year that totaled 1.8% of revenue because of the fiscal year end purchase\n",
      "accounting adjustments that had to be recorded in cost of services. Driver pay\n",
      "margin increased because of improved driver pay management and route\n",
      "engineering made possible by integrating the customer and route management\n",
      "databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the average weekly settlement paid out to our independent contractor\n",
      "drivers actually increased by more than 3% year-over-year while the revenue\n",
      "per driver rose by more than 7%. This is the triple win that you heard us talk\n",
      "about in past calls. Fewer drivers making more stops and therefore making more\n",
      "money driving fuller trucks on well designed tighter routes that permit better\n",
      "service to customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We compare to the March quarter, gross margin improved by 330 basis points\n",
      "almost entirely because of the driver margin improvements that I just\n",
      "described and then some smaller cost savings in the other areas of direct\n",
      "costs. Importantly, both of those comparisons would have been even better had\n",
      "we not experienced the substantial increase in the cost of fuel you heard us\n",
      "discuss back in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to adjust the settlement payment we make to our drivers every week\n",
      "because they literally need the money to fill their gas tanks. At the same\n",
      "time, the typical adjustment period for those customers that have fuel index\n",
      "provisions in their contracts is monthly, a few are bi-weekly, some are even\n",
      "quarter so there‚Äôs a disparity there. In addition, as we discussed on our\n",
      "earnings call in May, there were a number of customers with fuel index\n",
      "provisions that either didn‚Äôt exist or they were simply to divorced from\n",
      "today‚Äôs reality to be useful and we had to renegotiate.\n",
      "\n",
      "That‚Äôs been completed but during the June quarter, those disparities cost us\n",
      "more than $1 million in the quarter of further margin improvements we could\n",
      "have achieved. If we move down the P&L to operating expenses those expenses\n",
      "included in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, as we showed in the press release\n",
      "were $20.6 million or 26% of sales compared to $22.6 million which is 27.5% of\n",
      "sales in the March quarter and $24 million which is 24.1% of sales in the June\n",
      "quarter a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our operating expenses compared to last year decreased in proportion to\n",
      "revenue in basically every expense category except the cost of our warehouse\n",
      "and cross dock facilities where we have purposely expanded to meet the needs\n",
      "of our growing retail store replenishment business.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we want to compare to the March quarter, operating expense declined in\n",
      "dollar terms and as a percent of revenue due to reductions in G&A, salaries\n",
      "and nearly every other category of G&A expense with the exception of legal\n",
      "expenses as Vince mentioned, in connection with the class action lawsuits\n",
      "related to the employment status of our independent contract drivers and the\n",
      "Office Depot legal action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, during the quarter as you have all seen, the company reported a non-cash\n",
      "goodwill impairment charge of $46.7 million based on our determination of the\n",
      "fair market value of the company compared to the book value of all of our\n",
      "assets and liabilities. As you all know, the major portion of our goodwill\n",
      "asset rose in connection with the CD&L merger. Net interest expense in the\n",
      "quarter moved up from $5 million in March and June a year ago to $7.3 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is due to an increase in the interest rate on the senior secured notes\n",
      "due 2010 and an increase in the non-cash amortization of the debt discount\n",
      "associated with the debt restructuring that we announced on May 19th. The\n",
      "result of all those puts and takes is an adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was\n",
      "$2.1 million. That compares to $2.8 million from a year ago but, please\n",
      "remember that last year‚Äôs adjusted EBTIDA number included a $1.5 million non-\n",
      "cash benefit from those purchase accounting adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can therefore look at our $2.1 million of EBITDA this quarter as a nice\n",
      "increase from what it was June a year ago and of course a very nice turnaround\n",
      "from a $1.7 million EBITDA loss in the March quarter. Now, we can‚Äôt move on\n",
      "from the financials without also talking about another element of the press\n",
      "release and that of course is the opinion of our accountants. When we filed\n",
      "our Form 10-K last night it contained a going concern qualification from our\n",
      "auditors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this announcement does not reflect any change or amendment to the\n",
      "financial statements or any reclassification of debt to short term. The\n",
      "opinion of our accounting firm is based on our history of losses which has\n",
      "resulted in negative working capital and a net deficiency in shareholders‚Äô\n",
      "equity. Now, as you saw me say in our press release this morning, obviously\n",
      "we‚Äôre not happy about a going concern opinion but we do believe we are making\n",
      "good progress in replacing our current revolving credit facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we‚Äôre successful doing that, that may permit us to reevaluate our position.\n",
      "We have executed a letter of intent with the US subsidiary of a major European\n",
      "bank. We finished the due diligence despite all the turmoil in the credit\n",
      "markets we got credit approvals up until and including the credit staff at the\n",
      "parent bank two and a half weeks ago. Unfortunately, shortly after September\n",
      "25th the events in the global credit markets really accelerated and that\n",
      "simply slowed down the approval process beyond yesterday‚Äôs filing date for\n",
      "year end financials.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of yesterday, our financing partners in the US subsidiary remain optimistic\n",
      "that final approval is in process and that we‚Äôll be able to start\n",
      "documentation and closing in the very near future. Now Vince, I think that\n",
      "covers the most important financial figures that we needed to go over so I\n",

      "\n",
      "In fact, I‚Äôd like to talk a minute about what Ted just said about the\n",
      "accountant‚Äôs opinion. Currently, with our current lender we have a number of\n",
      "covenants and we made the monthly profit covenants so that is really not a\n",
      "problem. But, we have a driver pay covenant and as Ted mentioned with any\n",
      "spike in fuel it is very difficult because we pay the drivers weekly and in\n",
      "many instances we don‚Äôt get the fuel surcharge for a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, what we really have because of this basic lag in customer receipts\n",
      "in certain weeks we do not meet the bank covenant or have not met the bank\n",
      "covenant for driver pay purchase transportation even though as I said, we did\n",
      "achieve the monthly profit covenant in every month. As a result of this\n",
      "structural disparity what we really have on a going forward basis is we can‚Äôt\n",
      "show the auditors and we can‚Äôt get a future waiver because it is in the credit\n",
      "agreement so our only choice is really to replace the overall credit\n",
      "agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "From our standpoint, we really believe that you cannot have a driver pay\n",
      "purchase transportation covenant even though it is the largest expense\n",
      "category because from an overall perspective you will have week-to-week\n",
      "changes. Obviously, if it had been a monthly covenant it really wouldn‚Äôt have\n",
      "been a problem but our current lender really wanted to see week-to-week\n",
      "progress and that‚Äôs not the way to measure this business.\n",
      "\n",
      "From our perspective as Ted mentioned we really thought that we would have the\n",
      "lender replaced but when the credit market basically just tightened up it was\n",
      "impossible to get it completed before the audit. Even though I have to say,\n",
      "that we tried like hell to get it done and we thought we might have had it\n",
      "done but rather than not file the 10-K timely we decided we would file the\n",
      "10-K with this going concern which we believe is from our perspective\n",
      "something that we‚Äôre going to be able to rectify in the near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, what I would like to do is I would like to talk for a couple of minutes\n",
      "about some of the various questions that a number of people have asked and I\n",
      "have been, unfortunately because we were in this period where I couldn‚Äôt\n",
      "comment I‚Äôd like to try to give an overview in terms of some of the things\n",
      "that are going on within the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, we continue to diversify our mix of business. As we announced\n",
      "previously, we did sign a multiyear $30 million plus contract with a\n",
      "significant retailer and because of that contract we‚Äôve just been awarded a\n",
      "number of other major customers for an additional $8 million of annualized\n",
      "revenue. With the planned diversification of our business mix, we now believe\n",
      "that we are not vulnerable to any one business sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the financial institution sector is now less than 10% and it is\n",
      "interesting that a number of the financial institution that recently either\n",
      "declared bankruptcy and/or have been taken over where major financial\n",
      "institutions that we no longer had from a year ago. It was all part of the\n",
      "planned diversification process. In retrospect, we loss that revenue but it\n",
      "probably wasn‚Äôt so bad because there‚Äôs no more business for that particular\n",
      "account or they‚Äôve disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "From our perspective we‚Äôre very excited about the diversification. A lot of\n",
      "that is in the retail and healthcare sectors. In fact, I just returned last\n",
      "week from a major conference in Denver with Jack Duffy, the former Senior VP\n",
      "of Strategy of UPS. It was a counsel of supply change management\n",
      "professionals. It was interesting that one of the original founders, a\n",
      "distinguished professor of supply chain management at the University of\n",
      "Tennessee, Dr. Mentzer also happens to be a board member of Stage Stores, the\n",
      "major account we signed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was interesting because between him and Mr. Grubbs who is the senior\n",
      "executive of Logistics of Stage with 150 some odd people in the audience\n",
      "really said, ‚ÄúThe partnership with Velocity Express has worked so well that\n",
      "other retailers ought to be looking at the line haul infrastructure, the\n",
      "delivery infrastructure that Velocity has.‚Äù Because we have been able to do\n",
      "such a phenomenal job with the start up that we really began in July and\n",
      "August that Ted referred to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Grubbs has given tremendous recommendations to a number of other retailers\n",
      "and that‚Äôs one of the reasons why we‚Äôre able to report an additional $8\n",
      "million that is annualized that is going to be starting here very shortly.\n",
      "From our perspective we‚Äôre very excited about the diversification because\n",
      "we‚Äôre not at risk in any one category and we believe that with what we‚Äôre\n",
      "doing from a number of our strategic initiatives that we‚Äôre going to be able\n",
      "to be extremely strong in a number of key sectors from a growth perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key points that I talked about previously was our V-Trac 50\n",
      "Scanning. We have continued to increase our investment in the V-Trac 50\n",
      "scanners and in fact all 3,500 of our drivers will be using V-Trac 50 scanners\n",
      "by March. Currently 35% of our drivers have 50 scanners with our other drivers\n",
      "using the older V-Track 30 model. But, we have an aggressive roll out schedule\n",
      "to meet our March objective and our latest version of the 50 is GPS tracking\n",
      "capabilities which in our test have increased driver productivity by an\n",
      "additional 2%.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, we‚Äôve made the decision that once every driver has a 50 scanner\n",
      "we‚Äôll replace even the initial version of the 50 beginning in March. Another\n",
      "strategic initiative that I‚Äôve talked about on previous calls is the global\n",
      "alliance partnership. I should highlight here that we have NDAs from all of\n",
      "our bond holders and we also have NDAs from the key preferred shareholders\n",
      "which control the votes in each of the various classes. We have revealed to\n",
      "them who we are in discussions with from a global alliance perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don‚Äôt believe that this is going to happen within the next few weeks but we\n",
      "believe that everything that we have been working on, on a going forward basis\n",
      "really points to the fact that with our extensive US ground delivery network\n",
      "and the line haul infrastructure that we can offer a lower cost alternative in\n",
      "the United States for both European and potential Asian partners. Over the\n",
      "course of the last two months I‚Äôve been in China and also have been in Europe.\n",
      "From our standpoint, we‚Äôre very, very excited about some of the opportunities\n",

      "We are pleased to report that our third quarter results were quite good,\n",
      "consistent with our previous report. We achieved sales growth of 22% over the\n",
      "same quarter in 2007. Our pretax income for the latest quarter was $2.8\n",
      "million, which reflects an improvement of 55% compared to the year ago\n",
      "quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "We operated 54 branches at the end of the latest quarter, an increase of 6\n",
      "from a year ago. Of these branches, there were 47 that were in operation\n",
      "throughout both of the third fiscal quarters of 2008 and 2007; and these\n",
      "contributed same branch sales growth of $4.1 million or 20%. Our daily sales\n",

      "Our [distillation tower] for solvent recycling continues to positively impact\n",

      "2007, recycles used solvent using clean recycled solvents that we blend and\n",
      "resupply to our customers. During the latest quarter, our recycling throughput\n",
      "increased, helping us to reduce our accumulated stock inventory.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to our solvent recycling program, our reuse program captures used\n",
      "solvents, which we sell to industrial firms that manufacture roofing products.\n",
      "This is historically a somewhat seasonal market. During this third quarter,\n",
      "reuse sales were not as strong as the previous quarter and reuse inventory\n",
      "remains relatively flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the solvent that we buy is produced from crude oil, our unit cost for\n",
      "solvent continued to increase in the latest quarter. However, the fact that we\n",
      "cover most of the value of the used solvent through our recycling and reuse\n",
      "programs partially mitigates these cost increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "While our total volume of solvent products in inventory decreased during the\n",
      "quarter, increasing pricing during the quarter led to an overall increase in\n",
      "the value of our current inventory. For much of the quarter, we continued to\n",
      "experience increases in all our energysensitive costs, driven by higher crude\n",
      "oil prices within the cost of sales line in our financial statements. The cost\n",
      "increases on the solvent we purchased were more than offset by higher margins\n",
      "for our reused solvent sales and recycling program.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we benefited from the FIFO inventory accounting, so more reused product\n",
      "[inaudible] recycled solvent that had been carried in our inventory at\n",
      "historically lower value. While we have enjoyed the benefits of appreciating\n",
      "inventory values for the past two quarters, we don't anticipate that this will\n",
      "continue. If solvent prices decline further, we would likely need to record a\n",
      "reduction in the value of our solvent inventory. Although lower solvent prices\n",

      "\n",
      "It was good to see the samebranch sales continue to move up. Could you go into\n",

      "**Joseph Chalhoub**\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the sales increases that we experienced this quarter and last quarter,\n",
      "there are a lot of factors that go into sales increases. The surcharges are\n",
      "only a very, very small piece of that increase. The majority of the increase\n",
      "is organic, different lines of businesses, and price increase, including the\n",
      "surcharge, is not a big factor in that increase.\n",
      "\n",

      "On a longterm basis, when we think about samebranch sales growth, and you have\n",

      "Over the last several years, while we've raised parts cleaning prices a little\n",
      "bit more than other services, the average blended price increase has probably\n",
      "been in the neighborhood of 5%, plus or minus 1% across the board. The\n",
      "remainder of that would be volume growth in samebranch sales. I think that in\n",
      "the latest quarter it's possible that because of the surcharge, we could have\n",
      "picked up another 1%. I am just shooting from the hip here, but it wasn't a\n",

      "I can tell you we're continuing to see growth in customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we have not measured how much of our revenue growth quarteroverquarter is\n",
      "coming from brand new customers versus crossselling of services to existing\n",
      "customers. I think that, historically, we haven't made a big distinction\n",
      "there. Sometimes, depending on the types of service, the customer crossselling\n",
      "is a very integrated process, where we're really intentionally cross selling.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you understand, some of our services and routes are done by different reps\n",
      "on different trucks. From the point of an oil rep out calling on new accounts,\n",
      "he may be selling to somebody that he doesn't really care whether it's an\n",
      "existing Crystal Clean parts cleaning customer or not. He just wants to grow\n",
      "the line of business that he's responsible for with them. It might be\n",
      "interesting information. I don't have it at my fingertips to share with you,\n",
      "and we don't use that measure to kind of run or grow our business. We're\n",
      "really focused on both new customer acquisition and crossselling and our\n",
      "people are equally incentive for those activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Jeff Germanotta William Blair**\n",
      "\n",
      "My next question then is with oil prices falling, what customer pushback are\n",
      "you seeing in terms of price and what will be the forward impact of fuel\n",
      "surcharges?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Joseph Chalhoub**\n",
      "\n",
      "We haven't seen any customer pushback because of the price of crude reduction.\n",
      "Our solvent cost and diesel fuel, as we sit today, is still much higher than\n",
      "where it was the same period a year ago despite the recent reduction of the\n",
      "price of crude. If the price of crude stabilizes and the solvent price comes\n",
      "down and diesel fuel price comes down, then first we don't expect customer\n",
      "pushback. On the other hand, we may give back some of the surcharges.\n",
      "Something that we would decide internally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically we have had price increases for a variety of factors, including\n",
      "energy. So any price increase is not just driven by the cost of energy. Again,\n",
      "historically, we haven't had a customer pushback when these things happen. We\n",
      "haven't gone in and put a full price increase when the price of energy first\n",
      "was a factor for us. We were able to move that to later during the year. So we\n",
      "don't expect that. We may give some of the fuel surcharge, but it's relatively\n",
      "a smaller piece of our total price increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Gregory Ray**\n",
      "\n",
      "If I can add to that. When Joe talks about giving back some of the fuel\n",
      "surcharges, it's a marketing strategy that drives that more than customer\n",
      "pushback. We have now implemented our typical annual price increase in the\n",
      "fourth quarter. We were a little bit more aggressive this year with that than\n",
      "we have been in some prior years because of the greater cost increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "So tactically, what we typically would do is make that price increase\n",
      "implemented and if crude prices stay down where they are, or even move down\n",
      "further, we would probably then go back out to customers and slightly adjust\n",
      "or reduce the fuel surcharges with the thought that longterm, it would be our\n",
      "desire, if energy prices were stable, to have all of our pricing built into a\n",
      "single charge and not have fuel surcharges. One way to get there is keep\n",

      "\n",
      "**Joseph Chalhoub**\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefit of a lower cost of crude and really the product will way surpass\n",

      "\n",
      "We would look at the daytoday new business obtainment for us and all of the\n",
      "factors that we have. New customers and each line of the business as we\n",
      "regularly manage, and to the extent we want to push the growth at the higher\n",
      "level, we would do that by putting more resources. On the other hand, we are\n",
      "sensitive about cost factors and, as we do these things, we're attempting to\n",
      "maintain and improve our margins.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "If I could add, when we talk about slowdown in the economy, again, this is\n",
      "anecdotal rather than statistical information, but there are certain aspects\n",
      "of some of our customer base which we think helps us in a weak economic\n",
      "environment. I don't want to oversell that so you.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, on the vehicle segment side of our service business, we generate\n",
      "revenue from servicing automotive repair establishments that work on vehicles.\n",
      "If Americans are buying fewer new cars, they're often driving old cars longer\n",
      "and that may increase the service workload in the small shops of America that\n",
      "we count as customers. Additionally, I think as you know, we've often talked\n",
      "about how our service offers allow us to have a lot of pricing flexibility\n",
      "because they're very small ticket items to our typical customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Handinhand with that is the reality that for certain accounts out there that\n",
      "we want to penetrate, it's not worth their time to even allow us to make a\n",
      "competing bid. Because a manufacturing plant that has a $5 million annual\n",
      "spend, they might be spending $2,000 a year on parts cleaning. And we want to\n",
      "come in there and help them have a better program and save $20 a year, they\n",
      "don't want to give us the time of day. Sales guys sometimes will remark that\n",
      "when there's a little bit of economic pressure, they find those purchasing\n",
      "managers out there more willing to schedule appointments and listen to\n",
      "competitive proposals, because suddenly they're more interested in possible\n",
      "cost savings than they have been historically in strong economic times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those may be some reasons why we have not, as an industry, seen declines when\n",

      "keeping a lot of people in front of customers making a lot of sales calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then obviously, I remarked earlier about AR. That is one thing we will watch\n",
      "more closely in these economic times. If we start to see some deterioration\n",

      "When prices for our commodity, chemicals, solvents and fuels, hydrocarbon\n",
      "started to go up early this year, there was a certainly an argument that that\n",

      "\n",
      "The reason that we thought we could defer our price increase until end of the\n",

      "As Muhtar indicated, we've just again delivered strong financial results in\n",
      "the quarter. We reported earnings per share of $0.81 per share on a diluted\n",
      "basis in the quarter; however, this included a net charge of $0.02 per share\n",
      "for restructuring charges and costs related to global productivity\n",
      "initiatives, partially offset by the gain on the sale of a portion of our\n",
      "investment in our Pakistan bottler. Therefore, comparable earnings per share\n",
      "was $0.83 per share, an increase of 17% after considering factors impacting\n",
      "comparability in both the current and prior year quarters, our eighth\n",
      "consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable EPS growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Net revenue in the quarter increased 9% and increased 11% excluding the impact\n",
      "from structural changes primarily related to the sale of bottlers. Growth was\n",
      "driven by 2% favorable impact from price and mix, a 3% increase in concentrate\n",
      "sales, and a 6% increase from currency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the quarter, unit case volume increased 5%, cycling 6% growth in the prior\n",
      "year quarter, and year-to-date concentrate sales and unit case growth rates\n",
      "are essentially in line.\n",
      "\n",
      "We grew operating income by 20% on a reported basis. After considering items\n",
      "impacting comparability and the current and prior year quarters, operating\n",
      "income increased 17%, which includes a 9% benefit from currencies. Year-to-\n",
      "date, our currency neutral operating income of 9% remains ahead of our 6% to\n",
      "8% long-term target.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total selling, general and administrative expenses on an ongoing basis\n",
      "increased 8% in the quarter. This translated into 5 points of operating\n",
      "expense leverage. We continued to invest in our brands and build market\n",
      "execution capabilities. Marketing expenses increased at approximately the same\n",
      "rate as gross profit growth, and sales and service increased solidly to\n",
      "support our bottling operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our focus on expense management and productivity initiatives is reflected in a\n",
      "mid single-digit decrease in general and administrative expenses.\n",
      "Additionally, we continue to see year-to-date margin improvement in both our\n",
      "core business and in our Bottling Investments group. For the remainder of the\n",
      "year we would expect to continue to achieve expense leverage, but at a more\n",
      "moderate rate as we start to cycle some of the programs put in place late last\n",
      "year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our net interest expense decreased in the quarter, reflecting the benefit of\n",
      "interest income earned internationally at higher rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with regard to taxes, we ended up the quarter with an underlying effective\n",
      "tax rate of 22%, and we expect to remain at the underlying effective rate for\n",
      "the remainder of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we've previously announced during the quarter, we have curtailed our share\n",
      "repurchase program for the remainder of the year as we pursue the acquisition\n",
      "of the Huiyuan juice business in China. We repurchased a slight number of\n",
      "additional shares at the beginning of the quarter and now have bought\n",
      "approximately $1.1 billion of our stock year-to-date.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me address some of the factors that we see impacting the remainder of\n",
      "2008. We remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term sustainable\n",
      "growth and our picture of success remains to exceed our long-term growth\n",
      "model. We will continue to portfolio manage globally as we expect solid\n",
      "performance in most of our markets. While we expect economic growth in some\n",
      "emerging markets to moderate, we believe that key emerging markets like China,\n",
      "India, Eurasia and Latin America should continue, with solid business growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is our belief that among other consumer goods companies, our business will\n",
      "better navigate the current economic environment as we reach the consumer\n",
      "through a broader array of channels and packages with preferred brands.\n",
      "Improvement in our market share will continue to be a benchmark of our\n",
      "success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Globally, we are working closely with our bottling partners. The fundamentals\n",
      "of our business remain strong, and as a system we continue to take appropriate\n",
      "actions to navigate the near-term volatility while strategically investing\n",
      "behind our brands in the marketplace for long-term growth. Last quarter we\n",
      "revised our net capital expenditure forecast to approximately $1.8 to $1.9\n",
      "billion, and we'll likely come out close to $1.9 billion for the full year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, as you saw in the quarter, structural changes primarily related to\n",
      "disposal of bottlers, caused a drag on net revenue growth. We sold all of the\n",
      "Remil bottler in Brazil to Coca-Cola FEMSA at the end of the second quarter.\n",
      "We sold a portion of our investment in the Pakistan bottler to our Turkish\n",
      "bottler at the end of the third quarter such that we now own just under 50%\n",
      "and will no longer consolidate the Pakistan bottler, but include it in equity\n",
      "income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we will not have the offsetting impacts of the Norsa bottler in\n",
      "Brazil and PCAG, our German bottler acquisitions, as we cycle these in the\n",
      "third quarter, so we would expect a larger impact from structural change on\n",
      "net revenues in the fourth quarter and into 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving now to two key topics - liquidity and currency. Given the recent market\n",
      "volatility, I know liquidity may be top of mind for some of you. Our liquidity\n",
      "remains strong and our commercial paper program continues to function each day\n",
      "as broadly authorized by investors and is [praised] strongly. We have been\n",
      "able to continue to access 60 to 90-day terms and have not had a material\n",
      "change to our spreads to benchmark rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also have $2.2 billion of committed unused credit facilities from our\n",
      "network of relationship banks and our almost $8 billion in cash is available\n",
      "and in liquid, high-quality investments. Most of the cash is offshore, but we\n",
      "have reviewed our contingency plans and would be able to access the cash on\n",
      "short notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Year-to-date we have generated over $5.5 billion in cash from operations and,\n",
      "in short, liquidity is not a concern as we're able to fund our operations from\n",
      "internal cash generation and commercial paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to currency, as I mentioned, we saw a positive impact from\n",
      "currencies in the quarter on operating income of 9% and 10% year-to-date. We\n",
      "are maintaining our full year 2008 forecast of at least a mid single-digit\n",
      "currency benefit. We realized a stronger than expected benefit in the third\n",
      "quarter which we expect to be offset by a slightly weaker forecast in the\n",
      "fourth quarter, therefore no change for the full year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for our 2009 currency outlook, it is obviously a very volatile environment.\n",
      "We're already 100% covered on key hard currencies like the Euro and the yen.\n",
      "Emerging market currencies are particularly volatile, as we've seen over the\n",
      "last few weeks; therefore, it would be impractical to give a view on\n",
      "currencies for 2009 at this time. However, it is important to note that we\n",
      "manage our business in local currency to ensure that we make the right\n",
      "decisions for the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Muhtar indicated, we're in the process of finalizing our 2009 business\n",
      "plans, so we'll provide our outlook for 2009 on our year end call in February.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that's the topics I wanted to cover this morning. We're ready for\n",

      "In the third quarter CSX demonstrated its continued strength at a time of\n",
      "significant economic uncertainty. Like any American business today we continue\n",
      "to monitor our environment with vigilance. However, this morning we will\n",
      "provide you with the reasons why our business is resilient and can continue to\n",
      "succeed even through challenges in the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let‚Äôs start with our most recent results, yesterday we reported record third\n",
      "quarter earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.94. That\n",
      "represents a 40% increase from same period last year. Our strong earnings were\n",
      "driven by record revenues and operating income as well as our ability to\n",
      "sustain high levels of performance on our railroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenues grew 18% to nearly $3 billion for two primary reasons; first we were\n",
      "able to price our services to the value we‚Äôre creating for our customers and\n",
      "recover the high cost of fuel. Our customers rely on the service performance\n",
      "and efficiencies we offer particularly in today‚Äôs economic environment.\n",
      "Second, our diverse business portfolio affords us the ability to capitalize on\n",
      "growing segments even when other markets are experiencing weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the quarter the majority of our markets produced revenue gains despite the\n",
      "ongoing softness in the housing and automotive sectors of the economy. The\n",
      "gains were led by shipments of export coal, grain, ethanol, and metals. These\n",
      "factors, the capability to produce strong yields and the diversity of our\n",
      "markets create the opportunity to provide sustained earnings growth despite\n",
      "challenges in the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, our employees continue to deliver high levels of safety, service,\n",
      "and productivity. As a result, our operating ratio improved 250 basis points\n",
      "to a third quarter record of 75%. We continue on our path to the high 60‚Äôs\n",
      "operating ratio by 2010. The strong performance of our railroad in the third\n",
      "quarter not only reflects the excellent efforts of our employees but also the\n",
      "ability of our network to recover from major storm damage and disruptions\n",
      "along the gulf coast and in the Midwest.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning we hope to give you some insight into the underlying strength and\n",
      "potential of our business which is derived from a business portfolio we‚Äôve\n",
      "created and the performance we continue to deliver. With that let me turn the\n",

      "\n",
      "Our focus on leadership, discipline, and execution continues. That‚Äôs what\n",
      "drives results in our business and we will take us to the next level. Looking\n",
      "at the quarter, our safety measures show continuous improvement. In addition,\n",
      "we are delivering productivity to offset inflation and drive the operating\n",
      "ratio lower. Finally, operations were impacted by the weather in the quarter\n",
      "but the network remained fluid and stable and we expect service levels to\n",
      "improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "On slide seven you can see where the network was affected by severe weather in\n",
      "the quarter. The New Orleans line was out of service for over five weeks due\n",
      "to storm damage from Hurricanes Gustaf and Ike. During that time Interchange\n",
      "traffic with our Western partners was routed through other gateways, St.\n",
      "Louis, Memphis and Birmingham. These reroutes combined with heavy rains and\n",
      "flooding in the Midwest caused congestion in some carters and terminals and\n",
      "impaired key gateways. Overall the network was stable and with the New Orleans\n",

      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs look at the revenue performance by market on the next slide. As\n",
      "Michael mentioned earlier, nine of our 10 markets experienced strong revenue\n",
      "growth for the quarter. The only market segment that produced lower revenues\n",
      "was the automotive sector due to the declines in demand and production. In\n",
      "agricultural products, coal, and metals we produced significant revenue growth\n",
      "on both stronger yields and volume growth. The remainder of the markets\n",
      "produced revenue growth as pricing gains and fuel recovery more than offset\n",
      "the weaker volumes.\n",

      "Now let‚Äôs look at pricing on the next slide. As we have reviewed with you in\n",
      "previous quarters the line on this chart highlights the year over year change\n",

      "\n",
      "These shipments represent approximately 75% of our total traffic base. Same\n",
      "store sales price increases were 6.2% for the quarter consistent with the\n",
      "increases you‚Äôve seen over the last few years. Based on the service and the\n",
      "value we are providing our customers we expect our pricing momentum to\n",
      "continue into 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs look at the major markets. Quarterly merchandise revenue increased\n",
      "16% to nearly $1.5 billion. This growth was driven by stronger yields in all\n",
      "markets. Revenue per unit increased 20% more than offsetting the lower volumes\n",
      "which continue to reflect challenges in the housing and the automotive\n",
      "markets. We saw the most significant volume declines in our emerging markets,\n",

      "In terms of revenue all of the merchandise markets generated higher revenues\n",
      "with agricultural products, metals, and phosphates and fertilizer producing\n",

      "primary drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the next slide, quarterly automotive revenue of $195 million was 2%\n",
      "lower than last year. CSX volumes were lower, as North American light vehicle\n",
      "production once again declined during the quarter. However, pricing actions\n",
      "and increased fuel recovery resulted in an increase in revenue per unit of 27%\n",
      "which helped moderate the impact of lower volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to our intermodal results, intermodal revenue of $399 million\n",
      "increased 18% versus last year. Revenue per unit increased 18% in the quarter\n",
      "on higher fuel recovery and favorable mix. Volumes were flat as weaknesses in\n",
      "the international market was offset by growth in the domestic market. Finally,\n",
      "our continued focus on driving bottom line results through profitable revenue\n",
      "growth and cost control drove intermodal to record third quarter operating\n",
      "income of $97 million.\n",

      "Merchandise should see revenue growth in agricultural products, chemicals,\n",

      "\n",
      "**Oscar Munoz**\n",
      "\n",
      "On slide 23 and as Michael mentioned earlier we recorded earnings per share of\n",
      "$0.94 up $0.27 from the prior year. Starting at the top of the slide and\n",
      "working our way down revenues increased 18% and nearly $3 billion reflecting\n",
      "our strong service product and our focus on yield management and fuel\n",
      "recovery. This revenue growth along with our continued focus on cost\n",
      "efficiency drove an all time quarterly record operating income of $733 million\n",
      "a 31% increase over last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we move below the line other income decreased $6 million and interest\n",
      "expense driven by the incremental debt issued over the last year increased $29\n",
      "million. Next income taxes increased $55 million due to the improvement in\n",
      "this years earnings. Finally, the number of fully diluted shares outstanding\n",
      "is 37 million lower reflecting the ongoing impact of our share repurchase\n",
      "program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs review the key drivers of our operating income results on the next\n",
      "slide. In addition to our core earnings momentum two unique items impacted our\n",
      "results in the quarter. First, we experienced a $44 million impact from recent\n",
      "storms which included lost revenue as well as expenses related to asset write\n",
      "downs and reroute costs. However, nearly offsetting this impact was a $39\n",
      "million benefit in the quarter as a result of the two month lag in our fuel\n",
      "recovery program.\n",
      "\n",
      "After adjusting for these two items the real story continues to be the\n",
      "strength of our core business which delivered earning growth of $180 million\n",
      "driven by a sustained focus on the fundamentals of our business. This momentum\n",
      "is also driving margin expansion which I‚Äôll highlight on the next slide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the company‚Äôs operating ratio improved 250 basis points to a third\n",
      "quarter record of 75.2%. This improvement was driven by our continued focus on\n",
      "pricing and productivity which has been a consistent story over the last three\n",
      "years and has driven a reduction of our operating ratio of 800 basis points\n",
      "over that time. This quarter‚Äôs performance continues our drive towards a high\n",
      "60‚Äôs operating ratio by 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we turn to our third quarter cost structure on slide 26 overall expense\n",
      "growth was driven by significant higher fuel costs. Total expenses were up 15%\n",
      "overall and 7% excluding the impact of fuel. The increase in non-fuel expense\n",
      "was largely driven by the unfavorablility in MS&O which is the line item that\n",
      "contains the storm related impact. The remaining expense items collectively\n",
      "were essentially flat on a year over year basis reflecting general cost\n",
      "inflation offset by lower volumes and productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs look at our expenses in more detail and start with fuel. Total fuel\n",
      "costs increased 54% versus last year and the table on the right outlines the\n",
      "main drivers. Of course the primary driver continues to be the price of fuel\n",
      "which increased expense $173 million resulting from a $1.32 or 59% increase in\n",
      "the average price per gallon. Slightly offsetting this impact were lower\n",
      "volumes and our continued focus on fuel efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the chart to the left efficiency is measured by gallons per thousand gross\n",
      "ton miles improved 3% in the quarter and resulted in $8 million of year over\n",
      "year savings. The remaining variance in the quarter was driven by the increase\n",
      "in our non-locomotive fuel expense also reflecting a higher fuel price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let‚Äôs continue with our expense review on the next slide. Labor costs\n",
      "increased only 1% or $6 million from last year primarily driven by wage and\n",
      "benefit inflation. These increases were mostly offset by net labor\n",
      "productivity savings of $16 million associated with the reduction in train\n",
      "crew headcount. As you can see from the chart on the left we were able to\n",
      "lower headcount around 800 people or 2% year over year reflecting our focus on\n",
      "cost control.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a go forward basis we expect our labor and fringe expenses to increase less\n",
      "than inflation as we achieve our productivity objectives and you can expect\n",
      "that we will continue to size our resources to meet business demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to MS&O on the next slide these expenses increased 21% or $97\n",
      "million versus last year. This quarter‚Äôs results reflect a few key drivers.\n",
      "First, as I mentioned earlier the impact from storms in the quarter totaled\n",
      "$44 million of that amount $30 million of expenses are included here and were\n",
      "primarily driven by the write off of the lines destroyed by the storms. Next\n",
      "proxy related costs were $16 million in the quarter and we expect no further\n",
      "impact going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, our cost of risk was up $11 million year over year which was\n",
      "predominantly driven by derailment costs associated with high value cargo.\n",
      "Finally of the remaining expense items totaling $40 million roughly half is\n",
      "attributable to inflation the other half is driven by a number of smaller\n",
      "items none of which are significant by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to rent on the next slide, this expense decreased 7% or $8 million in\n",
      "the quarter as volume and lease related savings more than offset the decline\n",
      "in equipment utilization. The chart to the left shows payable days per load\n",
      "which measures the utilization of the freight cars where we pay rent. As you\n",
      "can see from the blue bars on the chart our total payable days per load\n",
      "increased 23% versus last year reflecting the impact from a significant\n",
      "decline in our automotive business.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you exclude these multi-levels our days per load performance still\n",
      "increased 10% reflecting the storm impacts of the additional time associated\n",
      "with reroutes and terminal dwell that Tony mentioned earlier. Looking forward\n",
      "you should expect our rent expense to continue to move with our business\n",
      "volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the next slide let‚Äôs talk about the remaining expenses. All other expenses\n",
      "increased $12 million or 4% versus prior year. Deprecation was up $7 million\n",
      "as the net increase in our asset base was partially offset by lower\n",
      "depreciation rates from the life studies completed in the prior year. Finally,\n",
      "our inland transportation expense was 8% higher driven by the increase in\n",
      "intermodal transcontinental business and general inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This concludes the P&L review for the quarter now let me update you on our\n",
      "share repurchase program, our liquidity position and financial guidance over\n",
      "the next few slides. Starting with our share buy back program on slide 32 the\n",
      "company has repurchased almost $4 billion or close to 90 million shares of its\n",
      "outstanding common stock since 2006.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the third quarter of this year we repurchased $836 million or just over\n",
      "14 million shares. With the remaining $2 billion of authority under our\n",
      "existing program we expect our cumulative share repurchases to approach $6\n",
      "billion by the end of 2009. This program is supported by the company‚Äôs strong\n",
      "liquidity position which I‚Äôll highlight on the next slide.\n",
      "\n",
      "After satisfying debt that has come due in the early part of the fourth\n",
      "quarter we only have an additional $412 million in debt maturing through the\n",
      "year 2010. With our sound cash balance our access to investment grade markets\n",
      "and with free cash flow that is expected to remain strong going forward we are\n",
      "well positioned to weather the current crisis in the financial markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me wrap up with our 2008 guidance. Building on the results of our third\n",

      "year EPS now at the low end of our range of $3.65 to $3.75 on a comparable\n",
      "basis. We remain confident for several factors. As Clarence mentioned we see\n",
      "continued strength in pricing and we expect consistent same store sales\n",
      "pricing growth through the end of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, moderating fuel costs and continued cost control through our various\n",
      "productivity initiatives will help mitigate inflationary pressures and finally\n",
      "our diverse business portfolio is enabling us to grow earnings throughout the\n",
      "current economic cycle. In addition, we continue to expect strong free cash\n",

      "\n",
      "Both now and well in to the future the transportation outlook favors rail. Not\n",

      "be able to complete additional restructurings, but given the turmoil in the\n",
      "credit markets and the dislocation municipal markets, pricing on deals has\n",
      "been difficult. The largest of the three remaining issuers has made a decision\n",
      "on restructuring its two issues and deals are on our calendar to price\n",
      "depending on market condition. As these deals do get priced the balance will\n",

      "investment banking landscape. We have said all along that the current\n",
      "environment is providing long-term opportunity and we believe we still need to\n",
      "thoughtfully pursue opportunities for talent and market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constant in all of this change is our continued middle market focus and\n",
      "growth strategy to enhance our platform across geographies, products, and\n",
      "sectors. We have a unique opportunity to selectively extend our franchise and\n",
      "enhance our talent base with experienced individuals or teams during these\n",
      "challenging times.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see particular opportunity to add talent in public finance, equity\n",
      "distribution including electronic trading, and in our equity investment\n",
      "banking. We are being thoughtful and selective as we consider opportunities\n",
      "for additional talent. We believe the talent we are adding will translate into\n",
      "an improved market position and financial results. As an example we are very\n",
      "pleased with the quality of the public financing we added in California in\n",
      "June and they contribute positively to our results in the third quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2003 through 2007 this team was the top education underwriter in\n",
      "California based on number of issues. During that same timeframe Piper Jaffray\n",
      "was number four. In the third quarter of this year, the first full quarter\n",
      "after the team joined us, we were the top education underwriter in California.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also believe we have the opportunity for additional revenue because\n",
      "competitors are no longer in the business for once strong platforms are\n",
      "diminished. For example we estimate that since the beginning of 2006 for\n",
      "public offerings or issuers with less than $2 billion market capital, Merrill,\n",
      "Lehman, Wachovia, and Bear Stearns generated $1.9 billion of public offering\n",
      "fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public offerings were particularly robust during this timeframe, but the point\n",
      "is that we believe a portion of the significant revenue pool is now available\n",
      "to firms like Piper Jaffray. We are balancing the historic opportunity\n",
      "available to us with the realities of the difficult operating environment in\n",
      "the near to intermediate term.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to make a few comments about how we are approaching the\n",
      "compensation and non-compensation. As of September 30th our net headcount is\n",
      "down 5% since the end of 2007. More importantly, however, is the employee mix.\n",
      "Our senior talent headcount is down only slightly as we have added strategic\n",
      "hires in areas that we believe we had solid opportunities and reduced\n",
      "headcount in areas that were underperforming or had limited prospects. The\n",
      "junior and support level staff headcount is down 9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are intentionally retaining our senior client facing talent as we support\n",
      "our client in a global franchise and we believe we can rehire junior and\n",
      "support staff as we need to. Given the weak revenue environment in 2008, we‚Äôve\n",
      "experienced increased compensation pressure because we had added talent to\n",
      "build out our global franchise. We have certain compensation guarantees and we\n",
      "have fixed equity amortization expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "We‚Äôve adjusted incentives downward, which is appropriate given our lower\n",
      "results. For areas that demonstrate performance, we will pay bonuses. For\n",
      "areas that don‚Äôt demonstrate performance, we will adjust incentives\n",
      "dramatically. Overall incentives will be down significantly compared to 2007,\n",
      "and we are continuing to adjust as we need to.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe we are taking appropriate actions with the goal of preserving our\n",
      "talent base to reap the market share gains when the market cycle improves. We\n",
      "acknowledge that our compensation as a percentage of revenues will be\n",
      "impacted. We expect it to be significantly elevated in the fourth quarter as\n",
      "well. We also believe to not take advantage of the talent available and to\n",
      "retain our current talent would be shortsighted and place us at a competitive\n",
      "disadvantage when the market cycle improves.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2009, our compensation model will be significantly more variable than in\n",
      "2008. Our guarantees will largely roll off at the end of this year allowing us\n",
      "more flexibility. As we add talent to the platform their compensation formula\n",
      "is variable based on revenues. We approached non-compensation expense with the\n",
      "same tenet as compensation that is we want to adequately support and enhance\n",
      "our global platform, and we need to be very disciplined about where we‚Äôre\n",
      "spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2008, our goal is to hold our core non-compensation expenses to a 5%\n",
      "increase over 2007. This is essential to allow for growth related to a full\n",
      "year of FAMCO and Piper Jaffray Asia. Our goal for 2009 is to reduce our core\n",
      "non-comp run rate. Year-to-date in 2008, our core non-comp run rate has been\n",
      "approximately $38 million per quarter on average.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our goal for 2009 is to reduce the quarterly run rate for our current business\n",
      "to about $35 million or a drop of 8%. We believe that this reduced base will\n",
      "adequately support our growth initiatives. In 2008, our revenue break even\n",
      "level has been approximately $115 million per quarter. In 2009, we expect all\n",
      "of our intended actions can allow us to break even at $95 million in revenues\n",
      "per quarter. This revised structure also provides us with more operating\n",
      "leverage when the market cycle turns positive. If we believe that the revenue\n",
      "run rate will likely fall below $95 million for an extended period, we would\n",
      "take additional actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In closing, I‚Äôd like to acknowledge our employees for working hard to\n",
      "communicate with our clients and guide them through some very volatile and\n",
      "uncertain markets. Although, the transformation occurring among large\n",
      "investment banks may create uncertainty as it derives fundamental change in\n",
      "the industry, the change also brings opportunity. I and our senior leaders\n",
      "intend to capitalize on those opportunities and come out of this environment\n",
      "in a much stronger position than when it began.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I‚Äôd like to turn the call over to Deb for more details on our performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Debbra L. Schoneman**\n",
      "\n",
      "For the third quarter of 2008, we reported net revenues of $72.7 million and\n",
      "recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $26.5 million or $1.68 per\n",
      "share. Included in the results was a $21.7 million pre-tax loss which we\n",
      "previously announced related to our TOB program. On after-tax basis, this loss\n",
      "was $13.4 million or $0.85 per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew largely covered the highlights of the revenue mix, but let me add one\n",
      "final comment on pipeline. Our current US equity backlog consisted of eight\n",
      "transactions compared to thirteen when we reported our second quarter results.\n",
      "We currently have two announced M&A transactions with an aggregate value of\n",
      "$713 million. Given the current environment, it is very difficult to complete\n",
      "transactions, and this may impact our ability to realize revenue from the\n",
      "pipeline through the balance of 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me turn to expenses. When it became clear to us that the revenue\n",
      "environments would not be improving in the second half of 2008 like we\n",
      "originally expected that it would, we reduced headcount by an additional 3%\n",
      "bringing the total for 2008 to 9%. The pre-tax charge associated with the\n",
      "additional headcount reduction was $2.2 million and is reflected in a new line\n",
      "item on the P&L entitled ‚Äò‚ÄòRestructuring Related Expense‚Äù.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reminder of the $4.6 million restructuring amounts or $2.4 million was the\n",
      "charge related to exiting leased office space in two locations. The annual\n",
      "sale associated with this action is $825,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "The severance and restructuring charges we recorded earlier in the year have\n",
      "been reclassified into the restructuring line item. In the third quarter of\n",
      "2008, we resolved the trading related litigation matter that we reviewed with\n",
      "you on our second quarter call. We were able to offset a majority of the $3\n",
      "million net expense that we incurred in second quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "During 2008, we have diligently managed our core non-comp expenses. We had\n",
      "increased cost to support our organic growth and some unanticipated cost like\n",
      "busted deal expenses. However, we will be able to completely offset the\n",
      "increases by reducing cost in other areas like technology, professional fees,\n",
      "and travel and entertainment. Some of the actions we have implemented in 2008\n",
      "will also benefit 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "In total, as we look forward into 2009, we‚Äôve identified specific actions\n",
      "across the firm to lower our non-compensation expenses by approximately $12\n",
      "million, which represents an 8% decrease over our anticipated 2008 full year\n",
      "non-compensation base. A large part of the savings will come from reductions\n",
      "in technology related expenses and travel and entertainment. The initiatives\n",
      "are well underway, and we anticipate we‚Äôll realize the savings radically over\n",
      "the quarters next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I would like to end with a comment on the changes related to our TOB\n",
      "program that we announced last week. As of September 30th, we consolidated\n",
      "$258.2 million of municipal bonds as assets onto our balance sheet. The assets\n",
      "will be categorized as level 2 from a fair value perspective consistent with\n",
      "our other municipal securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of September 30th, we at $89 million of level 3 financial instruments and\n",
      "other inventory positions which was down from $142 million at June 30, 2008,\n",
      "mainly due to the reduction in auction rate securities inventories, the write-\n",
      "off of the TOB residual, and lower ABS inventories. This represents\n",
      "approximately 11% of total inventories down from 17% on June 30th. These\n",
      "figures are preliminary, and we will disclose the final numbers in our 10-Q.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the change to our TOB program, the only other off balance sheet\n",
      "arrangements we have relate mainly to interest rate swap contracts, the vast\n",
      "majority of which are for matched book interest rate swaps for our public\n",
      "finance clients. The other interest rate swap contracts are for hedging our\n",
      "inventory exposure. All of these derivative contracts are mark-to-market\n",
      "daily, the results of which are recorded in our P&L. We also have a small\n",
      "amount of off balance sheet arrangements related to commitment for firm\n",
      "investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "That concludes our formal remarks, and now Andrew and I will answer your\n",

      "It is probably an understatement to say it has been a challenging year with\n",
      "record fuel prices and now we face economic uncertainties in the global\n",
      "markets and some uncertainty in terms of where the economies around the world\n",
      "are going to be performing. Through all of that, our employees have done a\n",
      "really good job and we thank them for their commitment to building the airline\n",
      "and providing good service to our customers and running a good operation. We\n",
      "appreciate that.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the September quarter we reported a net loss of $26 million excluding\n",
      "special items. While we are never happy to post a loss it is a modest loss\n",
      "considering costs related to fuel prices were more than $800 million higher\n",
      "than last year. On a GAAP basis we recorded a $50 million net loss which\n",
      "included $24 million in special items primarily related to our domestic\n",
      "capacity reductions and merger expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consistent with what we have talked with you in the past, we posted strong top\n",
      "line growth of 9% and maintained good cost discipline. Through our solid\n",
      "revenue performance, cost initiatives and fuel hedge strategy we were able to\n",
      "cover more than 60% of the impact of costs from higher fuel prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the operational side we are running a good airline. While we definitely\n",
      "faced some challenges this quarter with some severe weather and congestion in\n",
      "the northeast and an air traffic control computer outage, we had a five point\n",
      "improvement in on-time arrivals this quarter and Delta ranked in the top tier\n",
      "for on-time performance during the past twelve months. We also improved the\n",
      "customer experience with more than 50% decline in involuntarily denied\n",
      "boardings in the third quarter. Our baggage performance continues to improve.\n",
      "We had a 40% decline in the number of mishandled bags year-over-year in the\n",
      "September quarter and with more than 30 million bags traveling through our\n",
      "Atlanta hub each year the investments we are making to overhaul the bagging\n",
      "system are critical and we expect to see our baggage numbers continue to\n",
      "improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are making sure to recognize the role that our people play in these\n",
      "improvements. Delta employees received $10 million in shared rewards payments\n",
      "this quarter. I note that our good, on-time performance is coming with the\n",
      "most efficient scheduling in the industry. When you look at the spread between\n",
      "our block time reliability and our arrival performance we are running the most\n",
      "efficient operation in the industry. We are not getting it by adding spare\n",
      "airplanes and padding our schedules.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to focus on a topic that has dominated headlines in recent weeks; the\n",
      "credit crisis and how it is impacting Delta. The turbulence in the market\n",
      "coupled with a soft economy and high fuel prices have created a pretty\n",
      "significant financial storm, the effects of which have rippled through the\n",
      "economy in every market around the world and touched almost every consumer and\n",
      "business. I just want you to know we are well positioned to weather the\n",
      "turmoil in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last winter and last February/March we led the industry by announcing\n",
      "significant domestic capacity reductions in response to high fuel prices and\n",
      "signs of economic softening. When fuel prices continued to climb we responded\n",
      "quickly and decisively with additional capacity cuts. Those reductions are all\n",
      "in place now. Our domestic capacity was down 10% this quarter and will be down\n",
      "12-14% in the fourth quarter. We are continuing to trim capacity market-by-\n",
      "market as we watch demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were first out of the box with capacity cuts. If you‚Äôll recall we had a\n",
      "staff reduction of almost 4,400 people this last year. We will continue to\n",
      "manage that closely because we have a flexible, cost efficient fleet. We have\n",
      "a lot of airplanes that are paid for and the ability to change capacity and\n",
      "response demand is effectively a cashless exercise for us. We‚Äôre going to be\n",
      "doing that both domestically and internationally. I think Glen and Ed will be\n",
      "talking about a bit more international trimming we are doing in the fourth\n",
      "quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "We are not just removing capacity. We have been really committed to taking all\n",
      "the fixed costs associated with the business out when we do remove capacity\n",
      "and it has put us in a better position than our competitors to deal with the\n",
      "current market challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our liquidity balance remains strong. At the end of the third quarter we had\n",
      "$3.1 billion of liquidity which included about $800 million in the reserve\n",
      "primary fund money market. We have taken a small charge on our investment and\n",
      "we expect to recover nearly all of the investment as the primary fund works\n",
      "through its liquidation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are taking steps to preserve our liquidity with the amendment to our credit\n",
      "card processing agreement to extend it to 2011. We continue to have no hold\n",
      "back and do not foresee any hold back during the term of the agreement. We\n",
      "also have financing commitments for all firm aircraft orders scheduled for\n",
      "delivery through 2010. The fact we don‚Äôt expect to tap tight credit markets to\n",
      "finance those deliveries is really significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we had ahead of us a fairly significant opportunity with our\n",
      "Affinity Card relationships. As the industry deals with the turbulent times in\n",
      "the credit and equity markets and the potential for a global recession there\n",
      "is a key difference that sets us apart in our ability to manage through\n",
      "challenging times and that is our merger with Northwest.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can‚Äôt be overstated that the acquisition of Northwest clearly\n",
      "differentiates Delta from the pack by creating a global carrier with a very\n",
      "durable financial foundation. With combining two carriers that delivered the\n",
      "best pre-tax profit of the network carriers in the first half of the year and\n",
      "last year, Delta and Northwest have strong top line growth, best in class cost\n",
      "structure, solid balance sheets, strong cash position and the most capable\n",
      "employees in the industry. Together we will be able to improve our economics\n",
      "faster than either airline on a stand-alone basis by creating $2 billion in\n",
      "estimated synergies by 2012. That is very powerful considering the economic\n",
      "environment we are facing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have put a lot of work in to validating our synergy assumptions from the\n",
      "bottom up and we are very comfortable with our estimates we provided in the\n",
      "July 2008 investor update in terms of the timing of those synergies. When we\n",
      "first announced the merger it was more of a top down analysis and now we have\n",
      "actually done a significant amount of work in every piece of the organization\n",
      "and we know how we are going to get at it both on a cost and revenue side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The merger is a game changer and we are excited about hitting a number of\n",
      "milestones this quarter. Both the Delta and Northwest pilot groups ratified an\n",
      "unprecedented four-year agreement which will enable us to accelerate network\n",
      "synergies. The pilot groups have committed to a binding arbitration process to\n",
      "determine an integrated seniority list which we will have in the fourth\n",
      "quarter. The important piece about this day one because of our existing\n",
      "relationship with Northwest in the domestic and international alliance\n",
      "relationship we will be able to have full-up code share day one to be able to\n",
      "immediately begin capturing the revenue synergies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stockholders of both airlines overwhelmingly approved the merger in September\n",
      "so the owners of both companies clearly see the benefits of the merger. The\n",
      "EU, the European Commission, gave their approval and we continue to work very\n",
      "closely with the DOJ on their analysis. We still expect to close in the fourth\n",
      "quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FAA accepted our plan for transition to a single operating certificate. We\n",
      "expect it will take roughly 18 months to fully integrate the two airlines and\n",
      "begin operating under one certificate, although we will operate effectively as\n",
      "a single carrier right after closing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Northwest‚Äôs credit facility was amended, allowing us to close the merger with\n",
      "both companies‚Äô credit facilities in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you can see we are moving forward on integration planning and we are doing\n",
      "it with speed to ensure we start to deliver synergies to shareholders\n",
      "immediately. We are still targeting to close the merger during the fourth\n",
      "quarter as I said earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sum up, it is a tough environment. In a tough environment you have to be\n",
      "able to react quickly and be prepared to do the things that are necessary to\n",
      "manage the airline through these pretty tough times and in a tough credit\n",
      "market. We have shown a real ability to rationalize domestic capacity, grow\n",
      "the top line, stay very focused on cost discipline and that is important\n",
      "because you can‚Äôt just take the airplanes out. You‚Äôve got to take the fixed\n",
      "costs out that go alone with the airplane. And we‚Äôve got to maximize and\n",
      "continue to preserve our liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been a leader in the industry for the last several years with\n",
      "international expansion and domestic capacity discipline and we expect to\n",
      "continue to be a leader making quick, decisive action if demand conditions\n",
      "deteriorate. We‚Äôll continue to watch all of our markets closely and be\n",
      "prepared to pull back not just in the domestic markets but also\n",
      "internationally.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that I‚Äôm going to turn it over to Ed. [audio interference] Then of course\n",

      "We appreciate you joining us and taking your time with us this morning. As\n",
      "Richard said, excluding special items we recorded a net loss during the period\n",
      "of $26 million or $0.07 per share on a base of 396 million shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a GAAP basis we reported a net loss of $50 million which included special\n",
      "items totaling $24 million. The special items included a $14 million charge\n",
      "for early termination fees under some of our contract carrier brands, a $7\n",
      "million charge for merger related expenses and a $3 million net charge\n",
      "primarily related to facilities restructuring and some severance costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the quarter our $26 million pre-tax loss compares to a $363 million in\n",
      "pre-tax income in the prior September quarter. Fuel prices drove over $1\n",
      "billion in incremental expense for us this quarter and we were able to\n",
      "mitigate more than 60% of that additional cost through increased revenues of\n",
      "almost $500 million, productivity initiatives, and fuel hedging gains\n",
      "approximating $200 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the revenue front our operating revenue improved 9% or almost $500 million\n",
      "year-over-year despite a decrease in capacity. International revenue grew 32%\n",
      "year-over-year which reflects the benefits of our multi-year international\n",
      "expansion that we began in 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the third quarter 41% of Delta‚Äôs capacity was in international markets\n",
      "which compares to 35% a year ago. Delta‚Äôs consolidated passenger unit revenue\n",
      "increased this quarter by 9% which factors in a 6% increase in length of haul,\n",
      "making total length of haul adjusted RASM up 12%. Yield was up 7% while\n",
      "traffic was flat on 1% lower capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domestic passenger RASM increased 8% driven by our capacity reductions and\n",
      "pricing actions. Unit revenue growth has been accelerating through the quarter\n",
      "and into the fourth quarter. International passenger RASM was up 14% on a\n",
      "double-digit capacity increase in the third quarter which reflects both strong\n",
      "yields and demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are at a revenue premium to the industry. Our accelerated length of haul\n",
      "adjusted RASM as reported through the ATA was 102% of industry average year-\n",
      "to-date through August.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the non-passenger side our total non-passenger revenue was up 26% in the\n",
      "quarter to over $740 million which gives us a run rate on an annualized basis\n",
      "of nearly $3 billion of non-passenger revenues. Cargo revenue grew $42 million\n",
      "in the quarter or a 35% increase which reflects higher yields and volume,\n",
      "particularly in the international markets. Our other net revenue increased $10\n",
      "million or 23% which is driven by passenger fees, growth in our third-party\n",
      "MRO and Sky Miles revenue.\n",

      "\n",
      "We hedged 51% of our third quarter fuel consumption at an average all-in fuel\n",

      "during the period. Lehman Brothers was a counter-party on some of our fuel\n",

      "Lehman and have placed them to other counter-parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the quarter we incurred $25 million in mark-to-market losses on our hedges\n",
      "which are included in the non-operating expenses. Non-operating expenses\n",
      "increased roughly $90 million in the quarter. About 2/3 of that increase were\n",
      "quarter specific and should not be factored into going forward run rates.\n",
      "Those are the $25 million mark-to-market on fuel hedges, $26 million of\n",

      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm going to skip now slide three and go right to getting into the results for\n",
      "the investment bank on slide four. So here you see the investment bank had\n",
      "$882 million of net income on pre-tax income of $16 million so that‚Äôs really\n",
      "the flow-through of the deferred tax liability benefit that I talked about on\n",

      "\n",
      "If you now work down the P&L for the business, $4 billion of overall revenues,\n",
      "piece of that included $1.6 billion of investment banking fee revenues, up 20%\n",
      "year-over-year and you‚Äôll see on the next slide that we continue to be leading\n",
      "market share across the league tables as well as the top, this $1.6 billion\n",
      "for the year-to-date equivalent is actually the top fee earner on the street.\n",
      "So I feel very good about the investment banking fee franchise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving along to fixed income markets you see we had on the revenue side a\n",
      "total of $815 million of revenues. That includes $2.6 billion of write-downs\n",
      "related to our mortgage positions that we‚Äôve been talking about before as well\n",
      "as $1 billion related to leverage lending. I‚Äôll show you a slide on each of\n",
      "those so we won‚Äôt go into that in more detail right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then underlying that in fixed income it was a very strong results in a\n",
      "bunch of other areas, record results in rates and currencies, credit trading\n",
      "very strong emerging markets and commodities. On the equity market side, you\n",
      "see $1.650 billion of revenues, up strongly year-over-year and that‚Äôs on\n",
      "strong client revenue and on the trading side. And then lastly you see credit\n",
      "portfolio down a lot from a year ago but that‚Äôs really related to derivative\n",
      "receivables, the widening of our counter party credit spreads obviously\n",
      "driving the values lower there and the negative revenues which in large part\n",
      "offset the benefit that you see in the bullets in fixed income markets and\n",
      "equity markets related to the benefit we get on our own credit spread\n",
      "widening.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the credit cost line you see $234 million of credit costs, actually the\n",
      "preponderance of that is additions to loan loss allowance, only $13 million of\n",
      "actual charge-offs in the quarter that brings the allowance for loan losses in\n",
      "the investment bank to $2.7 billion for the 3.85% reserves to loans ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the last point I‚Äôll make here is you see at the bottom the end of\n",
      "period equity, $33 billion. I‚Äôll comment on the back of how we arrived at that\n",
      "but we really spent time in the quarter looking to refine our capital\n",
      "allocation methodologies to our businesses and you can think of this as a\n",
      "common equity equivalent for the investment bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving along to slide five, I‚Äôm going to skip it, but you won‚Äôt go through it\n",
      "here, but you can see for yourself the strong rankings we have in the league\n",
      "tables on the fee side. So moving to slide six, I‚Äôll just quickly comment on\n",
      "the legacy leverage lending positions. So you see we had net markdowns as I\n",
      "said of $1 billion for the quarter. That brings our gross markdowns to $3.8\n",
      "billion on the remaining $12.9 billion of commitments that we have for a 29%\n",
      "markdown to a carrying value on the balance sheet of $9.1 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that is a reduction of $3.4 billion or 21% from last quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to slide seven you see on the mortgage related side, same numbers\n",
      "we‚Äôve been showing you in prior periods. I‚Äôll start in the table, if you go to\n",
      "the left, you see the bottom line of the table $33 billion of mortgage\n",
      "exposure across the products shown here both residential and commercial\n",
      "reduced by $14.4 billion to end this past quarter at $18.6 billion for the\n",
      "investment bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you look at the first bullet below the table, that reduction in two parts,\n",
      "$2.6 billion of write-downs as I talked about in the P&L, running through the\n",
      "P&L, as well as $11.8 billion worth of sales including $4.3 billion of which\n",
      "was moved over to our corporate investment portfolio which is the real buyer\n",
      "of these type of assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôll skip going through the details because you can read them for yourself of\n",
      "what comprises the different buckets that we have on the page, you see in the\n",
      "next couple of bullets, but obviously we feel well marked here but when you go\n",
      "down to the final bullet, just to explain how we think about the remaining\n",
      "$18.6 billion, we would think about that in two ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "There‚Äôs a natural level of inventory that you need to support the ongoing\n",
      "trading and client activity in normal times. That could be anywhere from $12\n",
      "billion to $15 billion and so you see $12 billion right now of that would be\n",
      "assets of that very nature that you expect to be business as usual and flowing\n",
      "in and out the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that though we do have $6.6 billion worth of remaining positions\n",
      "from what we‚Äôve been through obviously marked down and we‚Äôre just going to\n",
      "manage that on a mark-to-market basis in a liquidating portfolio in the\n",
      "investment bank under [Bill and Steve] but remain, leave our trading debt\n",
      "focused on facilitating client business and put that in the hands of a special\n",
      "team to deal with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to retail now on slide eight you see again the main drivers as we\n",
      "always go through of what‚Äôs going on in the P&L so you see the growth in the\n",
      "branch stats, checking accounts up 10% you can read for yourself the growth in\n",
      "branches and ATMs, etc. Average deposits up 2% year-over-year and flattish\n",
      "versus last quarter but do feel good about the strength of this franchise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mortgages obviously originations on the mortgage loan side down some. Most of\n",
      "what we‚Äôre originating is conforming to government guarantee standards there\n",
      "and holding the market share gains that we‚Äôve had there. Home equity\n",
      "originations down 77% year-over-year. When you translate that on slide nine\n",
      "into the P&L for the retail business, we end up with the $4.9 billion worth of\n",
      "revenue in the retail business overall which is up 16% year-over-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "That drops down to $247 million of net income which is down from the year ago\n",
      "and prior quarter and the big reason for that is credit. So you see credit\n",
      "costs circled there of $1.678 billion. Obviously charge-offs are higher and\n",
      "you can see the charge-off rate overall down below at 244 basis points up from\n",
      "prior year and prior quarter but also included in that $1.7 billion of credit\n",
      "costs is $450 million of additions to loan loss reserves part of the firm-wide\n",
      "$1.3 billion increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition we added $250 million of loan loss reserves related to prime\n",
      "mortgages held in corporate. So I‚Äôm going to show you a couple of slides in a\n",
      "second on what‚Äôs going on in the major portfolios. Lastly at the bottom of the\n",
      "page same thing as the investment bank, you see the equity allocated to the\n",

      "to $25 billion in the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to slide 10, I‚Äôll talk you through the same slides we‚Äôve seen before\n",
      "on our major residential mortgage portfolios. So slide 10 is home equity. I‚Äôll\n",
      "just take you to the upper right box, the key stats, focus on the net charge-\n",
      "offs dollar line, so you see $663 million of net charge-offs, up from $511\n",
      "million last quarter. I‚Äôll just take you right down to our outlook from here\n",
      "on this is that we had talked about last quarter the pace of deterioration\n",
      "slowing off of what we had given to you earlier in the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has slowed but nonetheless it continues to deteriorate so our best outlook\n",
      "for the near-term is that quarterly loss that $663 million could trend as high\n",
      "as $725 million per quarter to $800 million a quarter over the next several\n",
      "quarters or so.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "On slide 12 prime mortgage, remember I said earlier that we carry some of the\n",
      "balances here in our retail business but many in the corporate segment and in\n",
      "the investment portfolio, overall the charge-offs on this portfolio of $177\n",
      "million in the quarter or 1.51%, that‚Äôs going to trend as high as $300 million\n",
      "by early 2009 and just to remind people, we talked about this last quarter,\n",
      "the increase in prime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to clarity a bit, this portfolio we have, mix drives a lot of what‚Äôs\n",
      "going on here. You see that 80% of our losses in the quarter came from\n",
      "California and Florida which represented 37% of the portfolio. The more\n",
      "important portion of why the charge-off rates are higher then you might expect\n",
      "is that this is not a well balanced portfolio by vintage so of the $47 billion\n",
      "you see in balances, about 50% are ‚Äò06, ‚Äò07 vintages which drive 90% plus of\n",
      "the losses related to this portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to card, slide 13, here you see we had profits of $292 million in\n",
      "the quarter down substantially from a year ago. Main driver again credit\n",
      "costs, $2.2 billion up substantially from the prior year, charge-off rate of\n",
      "5%, pretty much on what we previously expected up from 4.98% last quarter but\n",
      "essentially flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition on top of charge-offs we added $250 million to the allowance for\n",

      "grow by 6% from a year ago to about $158 billion and charge volume growth of\n",
      "5% when you translate that into, its modest revenue growth basically flat to a\n",

      "quarter‚Äôs earnings are $21.9 million in pretax favorable development and prior\n",
      "year‚Äôs loss reserves. The favorable development came from our Casualty and\n",
      "Surety‚Äôs book to business. In addition, we reported pretax net losses from\n",
      "both hurricanes of $21 million, roughly $5 million from Gustav and\n",
      "\n",
      "$16 million from Ike.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combined ratio for the second quarter was 88.3, resulting in underwriting\n",
      "income of\n",
      "\n",
      "$15.2 million. The soft market continues to impact our top line. Our total\n",
      "gross written premiums are down quarter over quarter 8% to $173 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the investment portfolio, it‚Äôs certainly been an interesting time\n",
      "in the capital markets. Our investment income declined 3% quarter over\n",
      "quarter. A large portion of our cash flow in 2007 and 2008 has gone to fund\n",
      "the share buyback program and short term rates are lower today than this time\n",
      "last year as a result of several Fed interest rate cuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other comprehensive earning shows a loss of $24.1 mill for the quarter. This\n",
      "is a result of market fluctuations and reflect the net change in market value\n",
      "of our $1.8 billion investment portfolio. Net losses on investments for the\n",
      "quarter was $24.2 million pretax. The majority of these losses were classified\n",
      "as other than temporary impairment charges. Most of these losses stem from our\n",
      "preferred stock portfolio for we held securities in the financial sector. Of\n",
      "that amount, $8 million represents losses not yet realized through sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously the events leading to a market decline are well documented. Fannie\n",
      "and Freddie taken into new conservatorship; Lehmans filing for bankruptcy;\n",
      "Bank of America acquiring Merrill Lynch; the U.S. government stepping in to\n",
      "save AIG; money market funds breaking the buck; three month treasury bill\n",
      "touching 0% yield; and Washington Mutual becoming the largest bank bankruptcy\n",
      "in history. Our portfolio is well diversified, but not immune to market\n",
      "corrections. We will compare favorably too many indices that cannot escape the\n",
      "fear that has spread across the capital markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our total portfolio return was -2.1% for the quarter, and -2.7% year-to-date.\n",
      "Our fixed income portfolio has an overall credit quality of double A, and a\n",
      "duration of roughly 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the turmoil in the capital markets today, I wanted to provide additional\n",
      "insight into our investment portfolio. We have not significantly changed our\n",
      "asset allocations since last quarter, with the exception of our preferred\n",
      "stock portfolio. At June 30 we had approximately $40 million or roughly 2% of\n",
      "our invested assets in preferred stocks. The changes in the marketplace and\n",
      "the fact that these issues were dominated by financial issuers has led us to\n",
      "substantially reduce our preferred portfolio. Today we have less than $16\n",
      "million in preferred securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the majority of our other than temporary impairment charges have come\n",
      "from the preferred stock portfolio. To provide additional color on our\n",
      "portfolio, I want to give you our investment allocation at 9/30. Roughly 15%\n",
      "are in corporate bonds; 12% in mortgage backed securities which are all Fannie\n",
      "Mae, Freddie Mae, Jennie Mae triple A rated; 18% is in straight agency debt\n",
      "triple A rated; 3% is in commercial mortgage backed securities triple A rated;\n",
      "2% is in asset backed securities with an overall rating of triple A.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our mortgage and asset backed securities are all senior tranches. We have 27%\n",
      "in municipal securities with an overall rating of double A; 3% is in a high\n",
      "yield muni bond mutual fund; 17% in equities; and 3% cash. We do not have any\n",
      "direct credit to fault swap exposure or derivatives in our portfolio. We have\n",
      "been purchasing equities in the down market but not aggressively. In fact, our\n",
      "allocation to equities remains less than our normal range of 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "We manage this exposure in relation to our overall insurance risks. We do not\n",
      "want to take excessive investment risks that will prohibit us from writing\n",
      "insurance business. When we look at our direct exposure to the financial\n",
      "sector, bonds, stocks and preferred stocks, this represents approximately 6%\n",
      "of our portfolio. I‚Äôm of course excluding Fannie and Freddie senior debt and\n",
      "mortgages from this total.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously October has been very volatile in the capital markets. Through\n",
      "yesterday the markets were down 14% for the month, 31% year-to-date. Our\n",
      "portfolio has a lower beta than the S&P 500 and tends to outperform on the\n",
      "down side. We expect to see continued volatility in the markets but believe\n",
      "that over the long run, our diversified portfolio will provide strong\n",
      "protection to policy holders while supporting book value growth for\n",
      "shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to our share repurchase program, during the quarter we repurchased\n",
      "42,600 shares of RLI stock at an average cost of $54.26 or nearly $2.3\n",
      "million. We have roughly $37.8 million of remaining capacity from the $200\n",
      "million repurchase program approved in 2007. During the quarter, we suspended\n",
      "the repurchase program in response to the developing market turmoil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since January of 2006, we have returned over $300 million to shareholders in\n",
      "the form of dividends and share repurchases. Despite this and the volatility\n",
      "in the markets, our statutory surplus has remained at roughly $700 million.\n",

      "environment, a major hurricane, at least one major competitor very distressed.\n",
      "Now maybe we can even call it owned by us. Equity and credit markets turmoil.\n",
      "Through all this the insurance market was fairly steady. There was a slight\n",
      "blip during the AIG uncertainty but it quickly returned to fairly steady\n",
      "overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall insurance prices down, but it now does appear that the rate of decline\n",
      "is slowing and we‚Äôre starting to see some signs of stability and maybe a turn,\n",
      "certainly in the D&O arena, the directors and officers arena, prices are up\n",
      "and the AIG instability is probably fueling that. [Inaudible] gross written\n",
      "premium for the quarter down 12%. Some of our products, GL, primary liability\n",
      "product, our largest product off 20%; rates off about 12% for the quarter;\n",
      "competition coming from all areas, including particularly the standard lines\n",
      "companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I would say there are some signs of optimism. On the rate front we\n",
      "saw in Texas during the month of September rates actually flattening and New\n",
      "York in the northeast rates have declined, slowing considerably. I would\n",
      "expect fourth quarter, first quarter of next year actually to be flattening\n",
      "out there so some signs of optimism there. Obviously the question of what the\n",
      "recession will do to the top line is in question at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our personal umbrella product gross premium was up 4%, our growing policy\n",
      "count and getting a little bit of rate in that product. D&L I spoke to a\n",
      "little bit. We‚Äôve not been a market for financial services. Rates are moving\n",
      "up in this area 10% or more and we‚Äôre seeing more and better opportunities\n",
      "given the instability of a number of the markets in that arena. Risk managers\n",
      "and D‚Äôs and O‚Äôs are starting to question some of our major competitors and\n",
      "letting them have large limits, taking our large lines on the D&O programs. So\n",
      "we‚Äôre optimistic that we‚Äôll participate in this change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Property gross written premium off 7%, quarter dominated by hurricane losses\n",
      "as John mentioned earlier. However rates in the Kat arena still off 10 to 12%,\n",
      "fire off a little bit less about 5%. I would expect to see some fallout from\n",
      "the major competitor instability. I haven‚Äôt seen it yet. I would expect some\n",
      "front rate firming due to hurricane losses, not seeing that yet either. But\n",
      "again I don‚Äôt think things stay flat, I think they turn and we‚Äôre more\n",
      "optimistic now than we certainly were last quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the marine arena we‚Äôre still growing out that business. It‚Äôs up 35% in the\n",

      "starting to see some progress there.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the Surety front good story, written premium up 17% in the quarter. All\n",
      "segments are participating. Obviously we‚Äôre going to be very careful as this\n",
      "economy slows in our contract in our commercial arena, but we feel like we‚Äôre\n",

      "Before I turn the call over to Nancy for an operational review, I want to\n",
      "address the question of our NASDAQ listing. As many of you realize change\n",
      "creates uncertainty. One of the casualties of transforming our business model\n",
      "from intellectual property to software has been a decline in our stock price.\n",
      "New investors are cautious while we establish ourselves, and this caution is\n",

      "identify spending not tied to revenue creation. Where found, he promised that\n",
      "we would act to reduce those expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, he stated that our plan is to generate cash in our operations which is\n",
      "manifested in a positive EBITDA during fiscal year 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "And fourth, he stated that we had analyzed many different financial scenarios,\n",
      "and believed that under all scenarios we had the resources to maintain health\n",

      "\n",
      "My remarks today are intended as a progress report on the guidance provided\n",
      "last quarter. Without question we are demonstrating our ability to grow a\n",
      "workforce management software and services business. While growth comparisons\n",
      "benefit from small numbers in a development stage, nonetheless, we saw 140%\n",
      "growth in our fully integrated software and services business in fiscal 2008\n",
      "versus fiscal 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "We grew from $4.2 million in revenue to almost $10.2 million in revenue. More\n",
      "importantly, we saw sequential quarterly growth of approximately 6% in the\n",
      "fourth quarter ending July 31, 2008, when compared to the third quarter ending\n",
      "April 30, 2008. That is an annualized growth rate of almost 24%. From our\n",
      "perspective that is evidence that the marketplace is embracing our solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, the nation and the world are facing some tough macroeconomic challenges,\n",
      "but the solutions we offer help our customers compete in any environment,\n",
      "including the tough times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, while we grew revenue significantly in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007,\n",
      "we were able to identify and pare operating expenses. We found for example\n",
      "that there were synergies that existed among and between our business units\n",
      "and we were able to reduce or eliminate overlap. We reduced headcount in the\n",
      "fourth quarter from 146 employees to a more efficient 105 employees by\n",
      "quarter‚Äôs end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, with our emphasis on efficiency and productivity, we are making solid\n",
      "progress toward achieving positive EBITDA by the end of fiscal 2009. However,\n",
      "achieving our goals also depends upon our customer‚Äôs ability to purchase our\n",
      "solutions at a rate consistent with our growth plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of our customers, I wanted to spend just a few more minutes\n",
      "discussing revenue generation. Ultimately our business model, which is aimed\n",
      "at generating significant and growing levels of operating profits, is\n",
      "dependent on generating an ever-increasing top line. It is also important that\n",
      "our revenue growth be with above average gross margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve these two revenue objectives we must maintain a leadership position\n",
      "in the features and functions of our products and service offerings, and we\n",
      "must continue to drive the appropriate level of demand to fuel our sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of product development we met several R&D goals during fiscal year\n",
      "2008, including delivering new products and significant upgrades to existing\n",
      "products. In NetSimplicity we introduced Mobile Workforce Manager, a new\n",
      "module that enables mobile employees to reserve workspaces and other company\n",
      "resources when telecommuting or traveling between facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we continue to enhance key features of MeetingWare Manager,\n",
      "including the Outlook plug-in and active directory support, both of which are\n",
      "capabilities in high demand by large corporate accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seventy nine percent of our $1.5 million increase in R&D spending this year\n",
      "resulted from the addition of iEmployee development operations. That group\n",
      "continues to make important product development contributions, including a\n",
      "number of enhancements in the time and attendance module to give users greater\n",
      "visibility and control over their time-off programs. The iEmployee development\n",
      "team also added EasyTouch Time Clock and an enhanced version of its HR benefit\n",
      "product.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of driving demand to fuel our sales funnel we continue to invest in\n",
      "the paper click-and-search engine optimization initiative for both of our\n",
      "product lines. With the marketing program‚Äôs investment in iEmployee we say a\n",
      "three-fold increase in lead since acquisition. In addition, as we learn more\n",
      "about our HR buyer we continue to evolve the marketing mix to reflect the\n",
      "solution sale approach and messaging for the iEmployee line.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, I‚Äôm proud of the work being accomplished by our talented and\n",
      "dedicated team of professionals in all areas of the company and at all levels.\n",
      "Our aim is to be a leader in the workforce management software and services\n",
      "arena. We are making good progress against our goals, but again, our ability\n",
      "to reach our goals in the timeframe outlined will also depend on our\n",
      "customer‚Äôs purchase behavior during these challenging economic times.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that I will turn the call over to Jay Peterson to provide additional\n",
      "texture to the financial performance during fiscal 2008 and the fourth\n",
      "quarter. Jay.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Jay Peterson**\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning I will comment on the financial highlights of the fourth quarter\n",
      "and then I will discuss some high level guidance for the future. I‚Äôll turn\n",
      "then the call over to Dick for some final comments, and then we‚Äôll take some\n",
      "calls from the investment community.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off I want to point out that sequentially our software and services\n",
      "revenue increased 6% in Q4 to $2.9 million, and that‚Äôs up from $2.7 million in\n",
      "the third quarter. Recurring revenues, that is revenue under either a staff or\n",
      "a maintenance contract, were in excess of 60% of our total revenue this last\n",
      "quarter. And our deferred revenue, that is revenue that we put on the balance\n",
      "sheet through this past quarter from $1.5 million to $1.9 million, a quarterly\n",
      "growth of 25%.\n",
      "\n",
      "In dollars, our gross margins increased almost eight percentage points,\n",
      "sequentially and that's from $2.2 million in Q4 versus $2.1 million in the\n",
      "third quarter of 2008. And overall, our gross margins increased from 76% to\n",
      "78% this past quarter. And as revenue increases in the future, those gross\n",
      "margins will increase also.\n",
      "\n",
      "We saw a sequential decline of more than 2% in operating expenses in Q4 versus\n",
      "Q3, bringing total operating expenses down to $3.6 million in Q4, compared to\n",
      "$3.7 million in Q3. In addition, we spent in excess of $100,000 this past\n",
      "quarter on litigation unrelated to our core operating software business.\n",
      "\n",
      "We reduced our EBITDA loss in Q4 to less than $900,000, compared to $1.25\n",
      "million in Q3, and that's a quarterly reduction of 30%. I will comment more on\n",
      "the EBITDA performance later in my remarks. Our annualized revenue per\n",
      "employee for the fourth quarter was $109,000 and this compares to $40,000 in\n",
      "Q2 and $75,000 in Q3. And as revenue grows, we believe that $109,000 is\n",
      "exposed upward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at our balance sheet and liquidity, we had working capital of $10.1\n",
      "million and cash and cash equivalent of $14.7 million as of July 31st. Our\n",
      "days sales outstanding for the quarter ended at 54 days, essentially flat with\n",
      "the 52 days in the prior quarter. And just to remind you, the company has no\n",
      "long-term debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 31st of 2008, Asure Software had Federal net operating carryforward of\n",
      "$156 million, R&D credit carryforward of approximately $5 million and\n",
      "alternative minimum tax carryforward of approximately of $0.5 million. And as\n",
      "we do become bottom line profitable in the future, our tax liability will be\n",
      "negligible for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this past quarter, we took a $7.4 million non-cash charge to write down\n",
      "goodwill, an intangible associated with the acquisition of our iEmployee\n",
      "business. This charge was due expressly due to our depressed market\n",
      "capitalization and did not have anything to do with our belief in the\n",
      "viability of our software business going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me turn to guidance. Our most important financial objective for our\n",
      "company is to achieve EBITDA profitability. In this last quarter, we lost less\n",
      "than $900,000 and that loss included in excess of $300,000 in expenses\n",
      "unrelated to our core software business. The majority of those expenses relate\n",
      "to a building lease that we have been trying to assign to a third party\n",
      "investor.\n",
      "\n",
      "On September 25th we reached a settlement with [Wild Basin 1 and 2], our\n",
      "current landlord, resulting in their granting approval of the assignment of\n",
      "our building lease to a third party. While there is a one-time charge of\n",
      "$75,000 associated with this assignment, we will realize in excess of a\n",
      "$200,000 reduction per quarter in operating expenses, plus forgo all the\n",
      "associated legal expenses incurred in the past, relating to this assignment.\n",
      "And we expect this assignment to close in the near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "And just to give you a feel for the financial impact of us being able to\n",
      "assign our lease, on a pro forma basis our EBITDA loss this past quarter would\n",
      "be reduced to less than $600,000 had we been able to execute the assignment\n",
      "before the start of the fourth quarter. So it is a significant pro forma\n",
      "improvement in our financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the final question is does Asure have the adequate financial resources\n",
      "to execute its financial and business plan? And we continue to believe that\n",
      "the answer is yes. In every one of our many financial scenarios we have\n",
      "considered and analyzed, and with almost $15 million in cash and investments\n",
      "and a current ratio of just under 3.0, we believe we have the financial\n",
      "wherewithal and the strong balance sheet to execute that business plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in summary, going over the quarter results, this past quarter we\n",
      "accomplished six things. One, we grew revenue. Two, we grew our backlog for\n",
      "our software business. Three, we significantly grew deferred revenues. Number\n",
      "four, we increased our gross margins by 2% to just under 80%. Number five, we\n",
      "reduced operating expenses and headcount this past quarter, and six, most\n",
      "important, we reduced our EBITDA loss by 30%.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Dick Snyder, who'll have\n",
      "some closing remarks before opening it up for questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Richard Snyder**\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, just a few closing thoughts. I believe we're standing at the\n",
      "intersection of technology, need and opportunity. At no time in history has\n",
      "there been a greater need for software and services that bring together\n",
      "efficiencies to the management of the enterprise workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Macroeconomic challenges are driving companies and organizations towards\n",
      "solutions that increase their operating margins while creating higher levels\n",
      "of employee satisfaction. Asure Software's operational imperative is to assist\n",
      "companies in a broad range of industry verticals to increase their\n",
      "profitability, while competing in their respective market places more\n",
      "effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have made good progress this last quarter in growing revenue and reducing\n",
      "cost and moving toward profitability, and I assure you that that focus will\n",
      "continue. Again, thank you for joining us today to hear this progress report\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me focus on the actions we have taken as a result of the extraordinary\n",

      "interests of our customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "First let me bring you up to date with some of the current activities we have\n",
      "been involved with. We are pleased to be included as one of the nine\n",
      "institutions chosen by the US treasury to take a leadership role in the\n",
      "recently announced Capital Purchase Program that forms part of the TARP. Our\n",

      "of the infrastructure of the financial markets and we are confident that the\n",
      "plan helps to restore stability and confidence to the financial markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also participating as a service provider in a number of Federal Reserve\n",
      "and Treasury programs to address the financial crisis. Acting on behalf of\n",
      "money market funds we have been one of the leading participants in the asset-\n",
      "backed commercial paper money market facility known as AMLF.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have also, just yesterday, been selected as the custody provider for the\n",
      "recently announced commercial paper funding facility, or CPFF as it is known.\n",
      "State Street Global Advisors is also pleased to be one of the two managers\n",
      "selected by the US Treasury to manage the assets of the mortgage backed\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me begin with a summary of our participation in the Capital Purchase\n",

      "anticipate will be minimally dilutive to our shareholders. We have a strong\n",

      "prospects of continuous earnings and whatever advantage of strength we gain\n",
      "from this program will benefit us in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "That does not mean, however, that we will not consider raising additional\n",
      "capital to further strengthen our capital position under the right conditions.\n",
      "The CPFF in particular will help the market for asset-backed commercial paper\n",
      "in these distressed markets. The intent of the CPFF is to support the market\n",
      "for commercial paper which is vital to the capital markets. We believe that\n",
      "together with the AMLF this program should restore confidence to the\n",
      "commercial paper markets. Specifically, until the market becomes more liquid,\n",
      "the program will also provide an alternative source of liquidity to our\n",
      "conduits reducing the need to hold commercial paper on our balance sheet\n",

      "\n",
      "Also this morning, I would like to discuss the following issues that I know\n",
      "are on your mind: our securities lending program; our investment portfolio and\n",
      "the asset-backed commercial paper program; other issues that we addressed in\n",
      "the press release, including the Lehman reserve and the possibility of an\n",

      "We received a number of questions about our Securities Lending Program.\n",
      "Details about how it works as well as our view as to the future of this\n",
      "business, given the decision by several lenders to suspend participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "First let me say that Securities Lending provides a vital source of liquidity\n",
      "to equity, bond, and money markets, as well as reduces the cost of trading and\n",
      "settlement, thereby benefiting all market participants. Our Securities Lending\n",
      "registered and non-registered funds are operating as we expected. Our program\n",
      "remains strong and these funds are invested conservatively. None of our funds\n",
      "that support State Street Securities lending business has lost money for our\n",
      "customers. Due primarily to declines in the market, but also suspension or\n",
      "reductions in securities lending by some customers, we have seen assets in our\n",
      "lending program decline by approximately 20%. As a result, we have seen\n",
      "increased withdrawal activity from the collateral pools, but we have been able\n",
      "to manage these outflows in a manner that protects our customers from loss\n",
      "[ph]. The current spreads and volatility are expected to at least partially\n",
      "offset the impact of lower volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let‚Äôs talk about the asset-backed commercial paper program and the investment\n",
      "portfolio. As we have said in the past and Ed will discuss in a minute, the\n",
      "assets in our investment portfolio and asset-backed commercial paper program\n",
      "are of high quality. Very few have been downgraded and none are in default. We\n",
      "continue to believe that the prices are not reflective of the underlying value\n",
      "of these securities if held to term, but reflect a continuing lack of\n",
      "liquidity in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next the Lehman related reserve. As we have stated publicly, we have no\n",
      "unsecured exposure to Lehman Brothers. We do have a secured exposure to Lehman\n",
      "which is now part of the bankruptcy proceeding. We have indemnified certain of\n",
      "our customers with respect to repurchase agreements with Lehman Brothers\n",
      "Commercial Paper Inc. These repurchase agreements of $1 billion were\n",
      "collateralized by $1.25 billion of mortgages. Following the Lehman bankruptcy,\n",
      "in light of current market conditions, we valued this collateral less than the\n",
      "repurchase obligations, so recorded a $200 million reserve. We believe this\n",
      "reserve will be adequate, although we will not know the ultimate outcome until\n",
      "the collateral is sold or matures.\n",
      "\n",
      "We manage accounts that have the benefit of contractual arrangements with\n",
      "other financial institutions that allow the accounts to issue and redeem units\n",
      "at book value rather than at market value. The difference between market and\n",
      "book value on these accounts has increased to levels that may result in these\n",
      "financial institutions requiring that we sell the fixed income securities held\n",
      "in these accounts to limit any further risk to these other financial\n",
      "institutions. Such an action could negatively affect our customers and our\n",
      "reputation. Although we are not contractually obligated to do so we are\n",
      "evaluating whether we should provide support to these accounts. Although we\n",
      "have not currently committed to any course of action, a decision to support\n",
      "these accounts could result in a non-operating pre-tax charge of between $400\n",
      "and $450 million in the fourth quarter. While we are still considering our\n",
      "options, we want to disclose the possibility of a charge of this magnitude to\n",
      "you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now before I turn the discussion over to Ed, let me remind you our third\n",
      "quarter performance, especially in light of the environment in which we are\n",
      "operating, was excellent. On an operating basis, earnings per share in the\n",
      "third quarter were $1.24, up 8% from $1.15 per share last year and down 11%\n",
      "from $1.40 in the second quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operating revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $2.5 billion for\n",
      "the quarter, an increase of 12.4% from last years third quarter compared with\n",
      "a 9.5% increase in expenses to $1.7 billion on an operating basis. Compared to\n",
      "the second quarter of 2008 operating revenue on a fully taxable equivalent\n",
      "basis was down 6.1% and expenses on an operating basis increased 6.3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Return on equity on an operating basis was 15.4% in the third quarter, down\n",
      "from 15.8% in the third quarter of 2007, and down from 19.3% in the second\n",
      "quarter of 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our operating expenses in the third quarter declined 6% from the second\n",
      "quarter, due to our successful expense controls and we will continue to\n",
      "exercise this expense discipline as we have in the past.\n",

      "Thank you, Geoff, and good morning. First, I want to apologize for the two\n",

      "is Veterans Day which is a SEC holiday, so we couldn‚Äôt get it out today and we\n",
      "were not ready to get our operations release out in Friday so we had to have\n",
      "two releases. Hopefully everybody has a chance to see this morning‚Äôs release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year we embarked on a plan to create liquidity and to focus on\n",
      "our four identified core areas. And they are the Bakken and the Williston\n",
      "Basin of North Dakota and Montana, the Eagle Ford here in South Texas, the\n",
      "Power River Basin in Wyoming, and our West Texas legacy asset area. We have\n",
      "got good assets outside these areas and we are going to use those to create\n",
      "liquidity. And even some assets inside of our areas that are either non-\n",
      "operated, low working interest or isolated, could also be crystallized for\n",
      "value.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not an easy process. There are always bumps along the road. So\n",
      "predicting timing is next to impossible. This weekend we finished negotiating\n",
      "the sale of our Nordheim assets in the Eagle Ford DeWitt County. Definitive\n",
      "agreements should be signed today. For about $20 million cash we sold 544 net\n",
      "acres and approximately 64 barrels of equivalent production per day, which was\n",
      "about 50% gas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also late week we did execute a purchase and sales agreement with a large\n",
      "independent to sell our leases in the Alberta Basin Bakken play in Montana,\n",
      "for approximately $2.9 million plus an overriding royalty interest between\n",
      "1.25% and 5%. Now we also leased our minerals up there to the same party for a\n",
      "20% royalty. These are just the first of a long list of other assets of\n",
      "considerable value that we expect to use to create liquidity over the next six\n",
      "to 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also recently upsized our bank borrowing base to $150 million. I would like\n",
      "to emphasize that this was net of the Nordheim assets and production. We let\n",
      "the banks know early on to remove these from the borrowing base calculation.\n",
      "Now some would say that this sounds like a shrinking to grow business plan.\n",
      "It‚Äôs absolutely not. These assets sales allow us to clean up our balance sheet\n",
      "but our business plan is going to still allows us to grow production double-\n",
      "digits for the foreseeable future. It‚Äôs a good business plan. It‚Äôs all self\n",
      "funded.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now I will bring you up to date on what is happening in various of our core\n",
      "areas. In North Dakota, there is a [boom] going on, in case you haven‚Äôt\n",
      "figured that out. And consequently nothing goes as fast, as smooth as you\n",
      "would like. Winter weather also arrived a little sooner than we expected. So\n",
      "things have been delayed somewhat, frustratingly so. Our first three well pad\n",
      "in the Bakken, completions are underway. We do have one well on production,\n",
      "two more hopefully shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do announce the initial potential in shale plays. The Bakken and the Eagle\n",
      "Ford, we feel like initial potentials IPs are subject to too many variables.\n",
      "If everybody did the same practices on potentialing their wells it would be\n",
      "different, but everybody is different in their practices and consequently IPs\n",
      "can vary all across the map.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will intend to announce 30-day rates. We think most the variables have\n",
      "passed at that time. A 90-day rate would be even better. I will say that our\n",
      "first well is above our curve and we own a 76% working interest in it. Our\n",
      "company owned drilling rig has moved over to the Lillibridge east pad which is\n",
      "a four well pad. All four wells had surface casing set at about 2000 feet in\n",
      "record time and we are now drilling the first intermediate hole. We are at\n",
      "9900 feet this morning. Abraxas currently has about a 40% working interest in\n",
      "the Lillibridge east pad or four wells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down here in the Eagle Ford, a month or so ago we started the first of a\n",
      "multiwall program. We now think it‚Äôs going to be greater than ten wells. The\n",
      "first well, the Cobra B1H, we set a company record in less than eight days of\n",
      "drilling time. We drilled 15,150 feet of hole. This includes an approximately\n",
      "4,600 foot lateral. A 19 stage frac started today. So that well hopefully will\n",
      "be on production in the very near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second well in the program, the Mustang 1H, was drilled to 10,300 feet in\n",
      "a pilot hole and the Eagle Ford was logged. This was to satisfy some acreage\n",
      "earning requirements. We are now [uphold] and beginning to work on building\n",
      "the curve. The third well will be the Corvette C1H. That location is ready.\n",
      "The rig will move immediately to that from the Mustang. Abraxas has a 25%\n",
      "working interest in all of these three well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, during late August and September we experienced an interruption\n",
      "in a third-party owned gas plant that was taking our gas from the WyCross\n",
      "area, so we elected to shut our well and to not flare gas. We lost more than a\n",
      "month‚Äôs worth of production. Hopefully this issues has been solved on a long-\n",
      "term basis and we can expect to have a steady take of our natural gas from the\n",
      "WyCross wells as we bring them online.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Jourdanton area also in the Eagle Ford where Abraxas has a 100% working\n",
      "interest, we recently a commissioned a 22 square-mile 3D seismic survey which\n",
      "we will use to help evaluate the Eagle Ford, the Buda and the Austin Chalk\n",
      "under our acreage.\n",
      "\n",
      "West Texas, Spires Ranch, again we own a 100% of it. We recently drilled 891H.\n",
      "Came in with an extremely high initial potential rate. This is an open hole\n",
      "well and it‚Äôs un-stimulated. The rate did fall of fast which was no real\n",
      "surprise, but it has leveled off in the 60 to 70 barrels of oil per day rate\n",
      "along with some very high liquids gas. We have a number of additional\n",
      "locations that we are evaluating in what appears to be a higher pressure part\n",
      "of the reservoir.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in closing, with the Spires Ranch on for the entire quarter, three high\n",
      "working interest Bakken wells coming online during the quarter and at least\n",

      "dramatic volatility and equity and credit markets and the jaw-dropping\n",

      "and attention. There were many important elements in accomplishing our record\n",
      "third quarter results, so let‚Äôs talk about some of those details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Net interest income is our largest source of revenue, accounting for\n",
      "approximately 83% of total revenue in the quarter just ended. In our\n",
      "conference calls this year we have stated that one of our goals for 2008 was\n",
      "to achieve record net interest income in each quarter. In the quarter just\n",
      "ended, our net interest income increased 25.1% compared to the third quarter\n",
      "of 2007 and it was up 4.3% from the second quarter of this year. This gives us\n",
      "our seventh consecutive quarter of record net interest income. We continue to\n",
      "believe that achieving record net interest income is a realistic goal for the\n",
      "final quarter of 2008 and that will continue to be one of our goals in 2009.\n",
      "To achieve this goal in the coming quarters, we will need to achieve good\n",
      "growth in earning assets and maintain our net interest margin at or near the\n",
      "current level or hopefully improve it somewhat further. In each quarter this\n",
      "year we have benefited from meaningful improvement in our net interest margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our third quarter net interest margin improved to 3.82%, up 5 basis points\n",
      "from the second quarter of this year. In our last two calls, we have discussed\n",
      "that our first and second quarter results benefited from our increased level\n",
      "of investments in certain tax-exempt investment securities, and we said that\n",
      "we expected the benefits of these investments would go away as conditions in\n",
      "the credit markets normalized and yields on these securities returned to more\n",
      "normal levels or as these securities were called away. As expected, our volume\n",
      "of these investments diminished in July and August as many securities were\n",
      "called and yields on other securities dropped below a yield that was\n",
      "beneficial to us. However, when credit market turmoil returned in September,\n",
      "we once again found many good opportunities to both increase our volume of\n",
      "these investments and our yields on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our last call we stated that we estimated that these securities investments\n",
      "added about 3 basis points to our second quarter net interest margin and we\n",
      "stated that we expected the yields on these securities to be lower in the\n",
      "third quarter. We therefore expected such securities to be dilutive to our\n",
      "third quarter net interest margin in percentage terms while still being\n",
      "accretive to our third quarter net interest income in dollar terms. That‚Äôs\n",
      "exactly what happened. We estimate that our investments in these securities\n",
      "reduced our third quarter net interest margin by approximately 3 basis points\n",
      "although they still provided a positive addition to net interest income in\n",
      "dollar terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our volume of these securities has declined from approximately $290 million at\n",
      "March 31 of this year to $170 million at June 30 and $119 million as of\n",
      "September 30. If this portfolio continues to pay off as expected, our total\n",
      "securities portfolio will continue to shrink. In the third quarter our total\n",
      "investment portfolio declined approximately $47 million which was roughly\n",
      "equivalent to our reduced volume of investments in these tax-exempt\n",
      "securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the third quarter, we also benefited once again from further\n",
      "improvement in our spreads between loans, leases, and other securities and our\n",
      "deposits and other funding sources. This is evident in the growth in our net\n",
      "interest margin from 3.77% in the second quarter when we estimate that our net\n",
      "interest margin benefited approximately 3 basis points from favorable yields\n",
      "on the additional tax-exempt investment securities to a net interest margin of\n",
      "3.82% in the third quarter when we estimate that our net interest margin was\n",

      "In support of that statement, let me point out that the increases in our\n",

      "quarters of 2008 have not prevented us from posting good earnings in each\n",
      "quarter, including record earnings in the last two quarters. Earlier this year\n",
      "we provided guidance that we expected our net chargeoff ratio for the full\n",
      "year of 2008 to be in a mid-20s to low 30s basis point range. Based on our\n",
      "annualized net chargeoff ratios of 38 and 33 basis points respectively in the\n",
      "first and second quarters of this year, in our July conference call we stated\n",
      "that it seemed likely that our net chargeoffs for the full year of 2008 would\n",
      "be toward the top end of such guidance range. Our third quarter annualized net\n",
      "chargeoff ratio of 27 basis points brought our year to date results for the\n",
      "first 9 months of 2008 to an annualized ratio of 33 basis points. We continue\n",
      "to believe that our net chargeoff ratio for the full year 2008 will be toward\n",
      "the top end of our earlier mid-20s to low 30s basis point range.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the quarter just ended, we made a $3.4 million provision to our\n",
      "allowance for loan and lease losses. With net chargeoffs of $1.4 million for\n",
      "the quarter, this resulted in a $2 million increase in our allowance for loan\n",

      "In our last conference call we provided extensive details regarding some of\n",
      "our practices for accounting for and structuring loans, practices which we\n",
      "consider to be very sound and conservative. We are not going to repeat all of\n",
      "that again but it is probably appropriate to summarize a few key points.\n",
      "First, we have been very aggressive in promptly conducting thorough impairment\n",
      "analyses on non-accrual loans and leases and regularly re-evaluating the\n",
      "carrying values of foreclosed and repossessed assets. Our general practice has\n",
      "been to quickly write off any identified loss exposure from non-performing\n",
      "loans and leases and foreclosed and repossessed assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the quarter just ended, we continued our practice of aggressively re-\n",
      "evaluating the carrying values of foreclosed and repossessed assets and we\n",
      "recorded approximately $228,000 of non-interest expense during the third\n",
      "quarter to write down the carrying value of foreclosed assets to reflect\n",
      "changes in market value. Accordingly, we feel that we have little or no loss\n",
      "exposure from our existing non-accrual loans and leases and foreclosed and\n",
      "repossessed assets as of September 30. Second, we have been very aggressive in\n",
      "placing loans and leases on non-accrual status when we believe doubt exists\n",
      "regarding the ultimate collection of payments. Because of this conservative\n",
      "accounting practice, at September 30 we had some loans on non-accrual status\n",
      "which were still making payments, including some loans that were not past due.\n",
      "Third, in regard to a couple of other subjects which were discussed in detail\n",
      "in our last conference call, I would just remind you that we consider our\n",
      "practices regarding interest reserves for construction and development loans\n",
      "and capitalization of interest on loans as very conservative. If you have any\n",
      "questions about these two items, I encourage you to listen to the replay of\n",
      "our second quarter earnings conference call which was held in July and is\n",
      "available on the Investor Relations section of our website.\n",
      "\n",
      "In closing, let me repeat that our paramount goal for 2008 was to once again\n",
      "return to a record quarterly earnings pace. We have accomplished that in each\n",
      "of the past two quarters and we now want to continue to improve on that level\n",
      "of earnings. We are operating in the most challenging environment in many\n",
      "years but with our good growth and earning assets and the improvement in our\n",
      "net interest margins so far this year, and with our relatively good asset\n",
      "quality, sound capital position, and abundant sources of liquidity, we think\n",
      "we are in a reasonable position to capitalize on numerous opportunities and\n",
      "achieve modestly improved earnings growth in the coming quarters.\n",

      "\n",
      "Inventory increased approximately $2.5 million during the quarter to $35.4\n",

      "used in the same period last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "CapEx for the quarter was approximately $1.2 million. The company currently\n",
      "has fortunately 62 employees about 65% in the United States, 20% in Europe,\n",

      "Okay, thanks, Sean. So I'll start to talk about the oscilloscope products a\n",
      "little bit. As I mentioned the scope product line delivered a record summer\n",
      "quarter for LeCroy. In Q1, in July actually we successfully launched our first\n",
      "product to feature the next generation Apollo chip set, the Wave Probe 7\n",
      "series.\n",
      "\n",
      "We deployed the demos in the early part of the quarter, our trained sales\n",
      "force in the beginning of July, and we began shipping the product in September\n",
      "and it has been an absolute success so far. The feedback has been excellent.\n",
      "Our customers are particularly impressed by the scope's speed, responsiveness,\n",
      "and quite a number of less features. It's been a long time since I've seen our\n",
      "sales force so excited about a new product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now in the standard LeCroy playbook, we have always tried to discontinue old\n",
      "products as new ones replace them. Then we try to migrate the customers\n",
      "quickly to the new products. Based on a lot of marketing, the field visits,\n",
      "and significant customer inputs, we scrapped this practice when we launched\n",
      "the Wave Pro 7 in July.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some customers had build the Legacy Wave Pro and Wave Master Products, the\n",
      "predecessors, into their R&D processes and may not be quite ready to move to\n",
      "the Wave Pro 7, so we've continued to offer these products and will continue\n",
      "to do so as long as customer demand remains reasonable. This really turned out\n",
      "to be the right strategy in the summer as the older products continue to sell\n",
      "well in Q1 right along side the even stronger Wave Pro 7 series.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wave Pro 7 is just the beginning of our new product rollout campaign. Our\n",
      "pipeline is filled with exceptional new products that we expect to launch\n",
      "throughout fiscal '09 and into fiscal '10. For example, in addition to the\n",
      "Wave Pro 7, we entered a completely new oscilloscope market segment late in\n",
      "this quarter with the launch of our Wave A series. The introduction of the\n",
      "Wave A provides LeCroy with its first opportunity to participate in a sizable\n",
      "market for very low cost scopes with some 100 megahertz based with price\n",
      "points as low as a $1000.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the past two years, we developed a second, third party distribution\n",
      "channel to sell our lower price and [bend] with product line the Wave Surfer\n",
      "and the Wave Jet. Now the way they physically load the Wave Jet enables us to\n",
      "significantly expand our product line for our distribution network\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of the market segment breakdown, we saw only minor shifts this\n",
      "quarter. Computer semi-conductor and consumer electronics segment remains the\n",
      "largest component of our business at 32% of total. The automotive electronics\n",
      "segment and the data storage segment traded places as automotive increased to\n",
      "20% and data storage declined to about 18% of our total.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of geography, our European operation continues to set the pace for\n",
      "LeCroy quarter after quarter. Europe was up again more than 20% in year-over-\n",
      "year and we believe we're taking real oscilloscope market share in that\n",
      "geography. North America also performed very well reporting 10% growth year-\n",
      "over-year. As we've been reporting market softness in Japan continues to\n",
      "affect our sales in Asia. Overall Asia sales including Japan were down 7% and\n",
      "to give you a sense of how the rest of Asia is performing if you exclude\n",
      "Japan, Asia was up 5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking a look at the protocol business, on our last call I discussed our\n",
      "efforts to drive growth in the protocol business by expanding beyond standards\n",
      "such as USB, wireless USB, STATs, and STA and PCI Express. The pace of the\n",
      "rollout of new silicon adoption rates for these next generation standards have\n",
      "been slower than anyone had anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now despite this slower growth our Protocol business remains very profitable\n",
      "and the market share leader in each of our target segments. We've already\n",
      "begun executing a plan to reignite the Protocol group as a growth business for\n",
      "LeCroy and beginning in the second half of fiscal '09, we hope to see some of\n",
      "the results of our early efforts to broaden the areas of focus for this\n",
      "Protocol business.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time we still see opportunities for our core standards as the\n",
      "adoption of these standards begin to accelerate. And we're certainly prepping\n",
      "our advantages in each of our core segments with a significant lineup of new\n",
      "products. In August, we launched the world's first complete USB 3.0 Protocol\n",
      "analyzer solution, the Voyager, which is our sixth generation verification\n",
      "platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that the emergence of USB 3.0 also known as super speed USB will be\n",
      "a sizable opportunity for us. USB was LeCroy's first Protocol standard with\n",
      "more than 10 years in the market and we have a commanding presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of September, we also launched new Protocol tools for next\n",
      "generation six gig STAT and STA data storage standards leveraging our\n",
      "expertise in high speed serial data analysis, the new Sierra verification\n",
      "system provides unparalleled performance in this industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now a little bit on our outlook, so with one solid quarter in the books for\n",
      "fiscal 2009, we need to turn our vision forward and take a look at what the\n",
      "rest of year has to bring us. Unfortunately like many other companies right\n",
      "now, our crystal ball is a bit murky. While our execution has been very solid\n",
      "we're somewhat uncertain about the demand for oscilloscopes and Protocol\n",
      "alliances towards the end of calendar '08 and the beginning of 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're hopeful that our high concentration sales into R&D and our limited\n",
      "exposure to manufacturing applications combined with our impressive new\n",
      "product pipeline will provide some insulation for many global slow down and\n",
      "demand for test and measurement equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the first two full weeks of October in our second quarter, we continue\n",
      "to see a healthy demand environment. orders are significantly higher than the\n",
      "first two weeks of October a year ago which coupled with the strong linearity\n",
      "we had in Q1 would normally give us cause for optimism in Q2 but despite these\n",
      "positive indicators, given the external environment, we're keeping a sharp eye\n",
      "on indicators like elongating sale cycles and delayed orders that would point\n",
      "to a slowdown in our business. We feel well prepared to handle such a slowdown\n",
      "if necessary. We're starting with solid operating margins, good control over\n",
      "our expenses, and we are capable of reacting very quickly to any negative\n",
      "change in demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said all that, we feel it's premature to make any changes to our\n",
      "outlook for the full year which we just presented in August. Our full year\n",
      "guidance for fiscal 2009 is for revenues in the range of 167 to 173 million\n",
      "and non-GAAP operating income in the range of 17.5 to 18.5 million. Of course,\n",
      "this excluded non-cash share based compensation expense and the other items as\n",
      "we have defined in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with that, I think we've given you a sense for how well we're doing as we\n",

      "\n",
      "First on July 24th we announced the dismissal with prejudice of our\n",

      "It also precludes him from making any further disparaging public statements\n",

      "Once they once again efficiently grow their, once again they want to\n",
      "efficiently grow their home based business. Turning to our third quarter\n",
      "operating activities, the third quarter was highlighted by another successful\n",
      "international convention which we held here in Salt Lake City.\n",
      "\n",
      "This event is our most significant corporate sponsored event that we hold\n",
      "annually and we spent four days training, motivating, celebrating and\n",
      "recognizing all of our associates here. Over 7,000 associates were in\n",
      "attendance and we made several exciting announcements. The most significant\n",
      "announcement that we made were related to our new associate compensation plan\n",
      "enhancements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first enhancement is directly aimed at our top 25 earning and growing\n",
      "associates. We call this new enhancement the ‚Äúelite bonus.‚Äù This bonus is\n",
      "designed to deliver an additional 1% of sales volume points which translates\n",
      "to about eight tenths of a percent of net sales to our top associate leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "We think that this bonus is going to motivate our top 75 business leaders to\n",
      "grow their business through urgency since its paid quarterly and good old\n",
      "fashioned competition between them. The second enhancement rewards all\n",
      "business minded associates and we call this new enhancement our matching\n",
      "bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal under this new program is to create other business builders or as we\n",
      "call them platinum pace setters. As an associate if you enroll someone who\n",
      "becomes platinum pace setter, you qualify to earn a matching bonus on any\n",
      "commission that they earn in their first 32 weeks after they have been\n",
      "enrolled with USANA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on your personal status these new enrolling associates can earn\n",
      "anywhere from between 25 to a 100% match on any new platinum pace setter that\n",
      "they create. To maximize the effects of this new enhancement for both new and\n",
      "existing associates we held a prequalification period which allowed existing\n",
      "associates a second and final opportunity to achieve platinum pace setter\n",
      "status.\n",
      "\n",
      "This chance to re-qualify as a platinum pace setter generated a lot of\n",
      "excitement with our associates. In fact, sales and enrollments in the last\n",
      "couple of weeks of the quarter were near record highs for us. We believe that\n",
      "by increasing these incentives for our business model minded associates we\n",
      "will be more competitive in our market in relation to other direct selling\n",
      "companies and instill a sense of urgency with those new to USANA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further at convention we announced our operations in the Philippines beginning\n",
      "in the first quarter in the 2009. This is going to be the company‚Äôs 14th\n",
      "market. And, we find the Philippines to be very promising for us. Many of our\n",
      "associates have strong ties in the market and additionally according to the\n",

      "total about 500 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making it one of the 25 largest markets globally for direct sales. In addition\n",
      "to these announcements we also launched new products. We introduced two new\n",
      "energy drinks, our Rev3 energy and Rev3 energy surge pack. Rev3 energy comes\n",
      "in a ready to drink 12 oz can and the surge pack it comes in an individual six\n",
      "pack which are conveniently mixed with water.  \n",
      "  \n",

      "international convention and we‚Äôre optimistic that these improvements and\n",
      "additions will foster for us additional sales and future growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would now like to talk about our regional sales results. In North America\n",
      "sales were down 3% year over year. This decrease was mainly due to lower sales\n",
      "in the United States where the number of active associates declined by 3.2%\n",
      "year over year.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the good news is active associates has increased by 7% in the U.S.\n",
      "compared with the second quarter. As our more mature market, we are encouraged\n",
      "to see the number of active associates increasing in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let‚Äôs now discuss Asia Pacific. Year over year sales in these regions grew by\n",
      "7.6%. The growth was led again by Hong Kong which was improved by 39.1% over\n",
      "the third quarter of last year and Malaysia which increased by .2%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Active associates in the Asia Pacific regions increased by 8% compared to the\n",
      "same quarter last year 11, now this compares to I‚Äôm sorry second quarter\n",
      "active associates which increased by 11% with a 26.7% increase in Hong Kong, a\n",
      "15.4% increase in Malaysia, and a 10.5% increase in Australia New Zeeland.\n",
      "\n",
      "By making significant investments in our associates, through two compensation\n",
      "plan enhancements, we believe that we will appropriately position our sales\n",
      "growth and to continue to increase our profitability. So with that note I\n",
      "would like to turn the time over to Jeff Yates, our CFO.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Jeff Yates**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I begin I would like to make a brief comment in tribute to Gil Fuller\n",
      "who just retired from USANA as Chief Financial Officer. The setting we share\n",
      "this morning is important to him. He has served this company's stakeholders\n",
      "for many years with integrity and professionalism. He is a fine man and it is\n",
      "an honor for me to follow in his footsteps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to our third quarter results net sales for the third quarter were 107,\n",
      "excuse me, $107.2 million. An increase of .9% compared with $106.2 million\n",
      "reported in the third quarter of 2007. The slight increase year over year was\n",
      "primarily the result of growth in our East Asia region, driven by associate\n",
      "incentive programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing sales results to the second quarter 2008, we reported a decrease of\n",
      "$2 million or 1.9%, it‚Äôs important to note that the third quarter is\n",
      "seasonally our softest quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know that many associates take advantage of their home based businesses by\n",
      "vacationing with their families during the summer months and also\n",
      "traditionally associates also hold off purchasing in the weeks just prior to\n",
      "our annual convention in anticipation of new products introductions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other factors that suppress sequential quarter sales by approximately $4\n",
      "million include volatility in certain foreign currencies and deferred revenue.\n",
      "As a U.S. based multi national company for years our top line has benefited\n",
      "from a weakening U.S. dollar. In contrast to prior quarters when sales\n",
      "benefited from changes in foreign currencies net sales in the third quarter\n",
      "were reduced by $1.9 million on a sequential quarter basis due to a stronger\n",
      "U.S. dollar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally as a result of the four week recall qualification period\n",
      "described by Fred, a large number of orders were received at quarters end.\n",
      "Unfortunately with the large increase in orders, we were unable to ship all of\n",
      "these products before the end of the quarter thus $2.1 million in revenue will\n",
      "flow into the fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our gross margins for the third quarter of 2008 was flat to last year at 79.3%\n",
      "of sales. Speaking now of earnings. Third quarter earnings per share continue\n",
      "in operation for $0.50 a decrease of 28.6% compared with $0.70 per share in\n",
      "the same quarter of last year. This is the result of higher overall operating\n",
      "costs which can be explained by the following.\n",
      "\n",
      "Associate incentive expense was 41.6% of sales compared with 40.5% in the\n",
      "third quarter of last year. This increase of 110 basis points is due to a\n",
      "higher pay out rate of base commission, an increase in the amount paid for\n",
      "contests and promotions and increases related to compensation plan changes\n",
      "described by Fred and announced at our annual convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these enhancements we believe that associate incentives going forward\n",
      "will run about 42.5% of sales. Selling, general, and administrative expenses\n",
      "increased to 25% sales compared with 21.7% in the third quarter of the prior\n",
      "year and this increase was due primarily to the following.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, an increase in staffing and higher executive salaries totaling $1.9\n",

      "This higher tax rate is attributable through a decrease in tax benefits when\n",

      "revenue and costs as well as forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fuel\n",
      "costs, fleet plans and other matters will constitute forward-looking\n",

      "As you‚Äôve all seen in today‚Äôs press release excluding special items in the\n",
      "third quarter we posted a loss of $360 million, which obviously compares very\n",
      "unfavorably to the $215 million profit that we earned in the third quarter a\n",
      "year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in previous quarters this year, fuel prices were the big driver of our\n",
      "performance and the volatility of fuel prices continues to be quite\n",
      "extraordinary. The last time we were together on one of these conference\n",
      "calls, the cost of a barrel of oil was about $135 a barrel. Yesterday oil\n",
      "closed at about $79 a barrel, which is obviously a big drop but I do think we\n",
      "need to all keep in mind that $70+ a barrel for oil is not really a bargain by\n",
      "historical standards and volatility continues to be a significant concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "As so often seems the case in the airline industry, there‚Äôs another challenge\n",
      "on the horizon. As we have all witnessed over the last month, the financial\n",
      "markets are in turmoil and this is certainly having an impact on the economies\n",
      "both here in the United States and abroad. Events of this magnitude will\n",
      "undoubtedly have an impact on our business although how much of an impact\n",
      "remains to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôd like to reiterate that we have accomplished a lot over the last several\n",
      "years to prepare us for difficult times, and whether our challenges are\n",
      "historically high fuel prices or troubled economies we are continuing to move\n",
      "forward. As you will hear today we continue to take steps to ensure that we\n",
      "not only can meet our near-term challenges but also build for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "One big factor in our ability to navigate this tough road has been our\n",
      "capacity discipline. As fuel prices climbed throughout this year we have not\n",
      "been shy about eliminating unprofitable flying and attempting to improve the\n",
      "supply and demand equilibrium in order to gain more pricing traction. Earlier\n",
      "in the year we announced our main line capacity reductions of 11% to 12%\n",
      "domestically and 7% to 8% for the system versus the fourth quarter of last\n",
      "year, and we‚Äôre certainly on track to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the uncertainties of the economy and the volatile fuel environment, we\n",
      "are setting our capacity conservatively for next year as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to believe that a more balanced supply demand environment is\n",
      "necessary to offset some of the disruption caused by the economy and fuel\n",
      "prices, and we continue to do everything possible to raise revenues through\n",
      "higher ticket prices and the unbundling of our products and services. As you\n",
      "can tell from our third quarter revenues those efforts have begun to bear some\n",
      "fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "We‚Äôre doing our best to manage costs. Capacity reductions make that difficult\n",
      "so it will take some time to ring these costs from our system. But as always,\n",
      "costs will be a priority for us as we work through the planning process for\n",
      "next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to focus on the balance sheet. I think it‚Äôs fair to say we‚Äôre in a\n",
      "relatively good spot with approximately $5.1 billion in cash at the end of the\n",
      "third quarter, and we‚Äôre looking to further strengthen that cushion to help us\n",
      "better face the challenges ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has certainly been a busy quarter for Tom and his team. We closed the sale\n",
      "of American Beacon Advisors in mid-September, we raised several hundred\n",
      "million dollars in financing over the quarter, and we‚Äôve secured financing for\n",
      "20 of our 2009 737-800 orders in addition to the previous backstop financing\n",
      "that we talked about in the third quarter. That means we have financing\n",
      "commitments covering most of the 76 737s we expect for delivery in 2009 and\n",
      "2010, and given the current credit environment getting those deals done I\n",
      "think was a significant accomplishment and a credit to our treasury team.\n",
      "\n",
      "We‚Äôre also of course looking to the future. We have announced our joint\n",
      "business agreement with British Airways and Iberia. We have of course applied\n",
      "for anti-trust immunity with these carriers along with Finnair and Royal\n",
      "Jordanian, and we are optimistic on our chances of getting that approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to move forward with our fleet replacement program, and in the\n",
      "third quarter we increased our commitment to 76 737-800s over the next two\n",
      "years. We mentioned on the previous couple of calls that we‚Äôve been analyzing\n",
      "our next steps on the wide body front and I‚Äôm pleased that today we did\n",
      "announce that we have entered into an agreement with Boeing under which we\n",

      "\n",
      "While we certainly face near-term challenges along with the rest of the\n",
      "airline industry, we continue to be firmly focused on the future and building\n",
      "a company that can be successful for the long run. I do think it‚Äôs fair to say\n",
      "we have faced and met tough challenges in the past, and we plan to continue to\n",
      "do so. And in the process we hope to create the best outcome for our\n",
      "shareholders and all our other constituencies.\n",

      "**Thomas W. Horton**\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see laid out in the press release, we recognized a few special\n",
      "items during the quarter. The most significant of these was the $432 million\n",
      "gain associated with our sale of American Beacon Advisors. For the remainder\n",
      "of the call I‚Äôll exclude the impact of special items to more accurately\n",
      "reflect our performance on an ongoing basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excluding these special items, we lost $360 million versus a profit of $215\n",
      "million in the third quarter of last year, a change of over $575 million. The\n",
      "driver of this change was clearly fuel prices. Remarkably in this quarter\n",
      "alone we spent almost $1.1 billion more for fuel than we would have paid at\n",
      "last year‚Äôs third quarter prices. The good news is that spot prices for fuel\n",
      "have come down from the record highs of early July but fuel prices remain high\n",
      "and volatile by historical standards and remain an enormous challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "While fuel may have abated somewhat for the time being, these are\n",
      "extraordinary times. The turmoil in the financial markets reflects yet another\n",
      "challenge we intend to face head on. Through our efforts over the past several\n",
      "years we have put ourselves in a better position to face difficult times, and\n",
      "we continue to take action in light of these challenges. A part of the\n",
      "solution is to affect a more stable supply demand balance, and for several\n",
      "years we have taken a very disciplined approach to our capacity plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier in the year we announced capacity reductions that have begun to take\n",
      "effect, and we‚Äôll see the full effect of these cuts towards the end of the\n",
      "fourth quarter. These reductions will help to offset weakness in the revenue\n",
      "environment associated with a recessionary economy, and given that we think it\n",
      "makes sense to revise our capacity downward further for next year while at the\n",
      "same time accelerating our fleet replacement with more fuel-efficient\n",
      "aircraft.\n",

      "In terms of liquidity we have arranged financing for a number of our upcoming\n",

      "transactions and taken additional steps to reduce our capital expenditures\n",
      "this year.\n",

      "On the revenue front, throughout the year we have taken the initiative on\n",
      "several fare and fee increases as we work to ultimately pass along the\n",

      "reductions we have begun to see the impact to both passenger and ancillary\n",
      "revenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "There remains a lot more to do, and with that I‚Äôll first discuss our revenue\n",
      "performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our third quarter main line unit revenue increased by 10.9% year-over-year on\n",
      "yield improvements of over 13% while unit revenue for our consolidated system\n",
      "was up 10.4%. While we currently face a challenging revenue environment moving\n",
      "forward, yield and unit revenue improvements of these levels are encouraging\n",
      "and demonstrate the pricing traction possible under rational capacity levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our domestic markets third quarter main line unit revenue increased by 7.7%\n",
      "compared to last year on about 5% less capacity as yield improvements more\n",
      "than offset lower load factors. On the international front we saw\n",
      "unprecedented unit revenue growth in the third quarter versus 2007 across all\n",
      "entities led by Pacific and Latin driven by very strong yield performance. In\n",
      "total international unit revenue was up almost 16% year-over-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick product update. We have now completed the standardization of the 777\n",
      "first class product around the flagship suite and we‚Äôve installed our next\n",
      "generation business seat on all of our 767-300 and 777 aircraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "Latin America continued its positive performance this quarter posting a\n",
      "remarkable unit revenue improvement of almost 20% despite a very competitive\n",
      "environment in some markets. For our Pacific operations we also saw very\n",
      "strong yield improvement of almost 17.5% offset by lower load factors that\n",
      "drove unit revenues higher by nearly 14%. Finally even as competition\n",
      "continues to evolve under open skies, our Atlantic third quarter unit revenues\n",
      "were up 11.5% versus last year on a bit lower capacity driven by yields which\n",
      "were stronger by over 14% versus last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to other revenue items, third quarter passenger revenue for our\n",
      "regional affiliate operations increased over 3% even with capacity lower by\n",
      "about 4%. Total card revenues increased by over 17% year-over-year on strong\n",
      "yield performance. In other revenue we‚Äôve seen substantial increases from the\n",
      "fees we put in place in June including the first bag fee. So for other revenue\n",
      "we saw an increase of over $70 million or 14% versus last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the alliance front we were pleased to announce during the third quarter a\n",
      "joint business agreement with our one-world partners BA and Iberia. In\n",
      "conjunction with this agreement we‚Äôve also applied for anti-trust immunity\n",
      "with BA, Iberia, Finnair and Royal Jordanian. With the granting of the anti-\n",
      "trust immunity and implementation of the joint business agreement our\n",

      "There‚Äôs no denying that the Star and SkyTeam alliances have strengthened\n",
      "substantially over the last few years, particularly as they have extended\n",
      "anti-trust immunity to cover more of their member carriers. A stronger one-\n",
      "world will counterbalance this evolving duopoly and will help ensure customers\n",
      "have ample alternatives over the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our application for anti-trust immunity now rests with the regulators, and\n",
      "while we can‚Äôt make promises about the outcome of the process we believe we‚Äôve\n",
      "made a very strong case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to costs. While the spot price for fuel has decreased substantially\n",
      "since its peak in July, in the third quarter we recorded the highest fuel\n",
      "prices we have ever experienced in our company‚Äôs history. This drove a sharp\n",
      "increase in our third quarter unit costs which were up more than 22% year-\n",
      "over-year. Our fuel price came in at $3.57 a gallon consolidated. This\n",
      "represents an increase of 64% and as mentioned earlier this raised our\n",
      "consolidated fuel costs in the quarter by $1.1 billion more than we would have\n",
      "paid at last year‚Äôs third quarter prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excluding fuel, our unit costs rose by 4.3% main line and 4.4% consolidated\n",
      "driven by reduced capacity and headwinds from higher materials and repairs\n",
      "costs, facilities expenses and foreign exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in\n",
      "cash including $456 million in restricted cash. $5.1 billion is a sizable\n",
      "amount of cash but given the uncertainties with fuel prices and softening\n",

      "liquidity and we continue to seize on opportunities to build our financial\n",
      "flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the third quarter we completed the sale of American Beacon Advisors,\n",
      "raised $300 million from the sale of new equity, drew our revolver and we\n",
      "raised aircraft financing of over $500 million. Furthermore we have arranged\n",
      "financing for 20 of our 737-800 deliveries for next year, which combined with\n",
      "the recently-announced backstop facility will cover most of our 2009 and 2010\n",
      "deliveries. Furthermore, through our efforts to repair our balance sheet over\n",
      "the last few years we‚Äôve created additional financial flexibility, and even\n",
      "after these financings we still have unencumbered assets and other sources of\n",
      "liquidity that we valued at over $3.5 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the third quarter our scheduled principal payments on long-term debt and\n",
      "capital leases totaled approximately $500 million and our capital expenditures\n",
      "totaled about $200 million. On the pension front we have contributed $78\n",

      "minimum required funding obligation for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our total debt defined in the earnings release is now $15.4 billion. Our net\n",

      "versus the same time last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shifting to guidance, it would be an understatement to say the industry is\n",
      "facing big hurdles over the coming quarters. There is great uncertainty about\n",
      "the direction of the economy and the volatility and price of fuel remains a\n",
      "concern, both of which can significantly impact our business. With the\n",
      "weakening global economy we have seen softening demand with fourth quarter\n",

      "about a point and international down about 4.5 points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the year we‚Äôve discussed that the supply/demand imbalance in the\n",
      "industry was hindering our ability to pass along our costs to the customer. In\n",
      "May we took action by announcing our fourth quarter capacity reductions for\n",
      "the main line system of 7% to 8% and domestic capacity to be reduced by\n",
      "approximately 11% to 12% versus the prior year along with proportional\n",

      "our booked load factor statistics these reductions are taking affect not a\n",
      "moment too soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fourth quarter we expect main line capacity to decrease 8.3% year-over-\n",
      "year with domestic down 12.5% and international down 0.6%. On a consolidated\n",

      "expect full year 2009 main line system capacity to be down over 9% with\n",
      "domestic down about 14% and international about flat.\n",

      "Let me add that we‚Äôve been quick to act in the past when we felt that\n",

      "eye on the revenue environment and fuel prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to fuel, on a consolidated basis we forecast fuel prices to remain\n",
      "high with fourth quarter fuel price of $2.76 and a full-year price of $3.07\n",

      "We‚Äôve been diligent in monitoring our non-aircraft capital spending, and in\n",

      "the third quarter of 2007. The increase in product gross margin in the third\n",

      "Service gross margins in the third quarter of 2008 were 30% compared to 28.38%\n",
      "in Q3 of 2007. On a year-over-year basis, service gross margins increased by\n",

      "customers that came over with the MSCI acquisition and to an increase in\n",
      "Datalink delivered professional services. On a sequential basis, service gross\n",

      "we expect overall gross margins to be in the range of 26% to 27%.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the quarter, we saw revenues consisting of 38% disc, 9% tape, 8% software,\n",

      "the third quarter of 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third quarter GAAP were approximately $1.1 million or $0.08 per diluted share,\n",

      "quarter of 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "GAAP net earnings for the first nine months of 2008 were $2.6 million or $0.20\n",

      "On a non-GAAP basis, net earnings for the third quarter of 2008 were $1.3\n",

      "Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and investment balance at the end of\n",
      "September was $25.7 million, which down from $28 million at the end of the\n",
      "second quarter. The decrease in cash is primarily due to the timing of cash\n",
      "receipts during the quarter. In fact, we received two large payments totaling\n",
      "$2 million dollars in the first two days of October that were due in September\n",
      "and we also have another $1.5 million dollar payment that‚Äôs on its way as we\n",

      "\n",
      "For the quarter, we used $2.1 million of cash from operations, which is mainly\n",

      "So now with that as a background, let me now turn the call back over to\n",

      "\n",
      "**Charles Westling**\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting on Q3, overall we delivered a strong quarter and I am very pleased\n",
      "that we continue profitably grow our business in this very challenging\n",
      "environment. The team is executing well. We are taking market share in many\n",
      "accounts and I believe we are well positioned to weather the current and\n",
      "longer term challenges that many of our customers are facing, indeed we all\n",
      "are facing, in this world of economic uncertainty, tremendous market\n",
      "volatility, and credit and capital constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I look back on the third quarter and year-to-date results, I think it is\n",
      "important to highlight the fact that are team has delivered a revenue increase\n",
      "of more than $20 million dollars for the first nine months of the year, which\n",
      "represents an increase of 16% from the prior year period. More importantly,\n",
      "however, we‚Äôve improved our non-GAAP operating income by over 500%, from\n",
      "$875,000 in the first nine months of 2007 to over $5.3 million dollars in the\n",
      "first nine months of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is my list of the top five reasons why we continue to do well in this\n",
      "environment. First, our customer support business continues to be a shining\n",
      "star. Customer support revenues were at a record level in the third quarter\n",
      "and had increased over 30% through the first three quarters of 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are increasingly winning with support as a point of entry into new accounts\n",
      "and our customer satisfaction levels are consistently higher than industry\n",
      "averages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our investment in customer support and the leadership changes that we have\n",
      "made in this area over the past year continue to pay big dividends and further\n",
      "differentiate us from others who resell storage products and technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to providing us with more visibility and stickiness into our\n",
      "customer storage environments, support allows us to deliver a more predictable\n",
      "and profitable source of revenues as we manage the company for continued\n",
      "growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, our sales and engineering teams in the field are doing a better job of\n",
      "identifying, positioning, and delivering storage solutions that meet our\n",
      "customer‚Äôs business needs. The increases that we continue to see in product\n",
      "and services gross margins highlight the fact that our sales teams are doing a\n",
      "better job of selling and delivering value. Another reflection of our\n",
      "improving performance in this area is the more balanced mix of customers that\n",
      "we are seeing in our results.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we continue to grow our revenues, we do not have a single customer who\n",
      "represents 5% of our total revenue so far this year. I expect that as we\n",
      "finish out the year, 2008 will mark the first year in Datalink‚Äôs recent\n",
      "history that we will not have a customer represent 5% or more of revenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, though our practice is focused in initiatives, we are successfully\n",
      "transitioning more and more of our business into emerging areas in storage,\n",
      "which add very compelling returns for our customers. These areas include data\n",
      "de-duplication, systems and storage virtualization, and LAN optimization. It\n",
      "is interesting to note that virtualization de-duplication, and LAN\n",
      "optimization solutions as measured by revenues generated through our key\n",
      "technology providers in these areas have increased almost three fold through\n",
      "the first nine months of the year and represent an addition to customer\n",
      "support, the bulk of our growth in year-over-year revenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, we continue to grow our business and invest more in customer facing\n",
      "headcount while managing our corporate and back office resources and headcount\n",
      "very effectively. Our teams in this part of the business are doing a very good\n",
      "job of supporting the overall growth of the company and our customer base. Our\n",
      "general and administrative expenses are up just 3.3% for the first nine months\n",
      "of 2008, while our revenues have increased 16% during this period. The\n",
      "combination of top line growth, improving gross profit margins, and solid G&A\n",
      "expense management has led to the significant lift in our operating income so\n",
      "far this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth, as we are getting better at training and hiring our people, sharing\n",
      "better practices, developing tools and capturing our knowledge and\n",
      "intellectual property across our teams, we have been able to continue to\n",
      "improve the overall productivity of our employees. We strive to be able to\n",
      "generate at least $250,000 to $275,000 of annualized gross profit per employee\n",
      "on average each quarter to allow us to cover our operating expenses and\n",
      "deliver acceptable levels of profits to our shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been consistently in this range so far in each quarter of this year\n",
      "and we saw this metric improve by 14% in Q308 versus Q307.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me now turn to our outlook for Q4. During the third quarter, we did start\n",
      "to see the impact of tightening credit conditions for a few of our customers,\n",
      "which resulted in delayed and in some instances scale down purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of backlog, we ended Q2 at $32 million versus $31 million at the end\n",
      "of Q3. All things being equal, this would suggest flat to slightly lower\n",
      "revenues for Q4 versus Q3. On the other hand, as we have gone back and\n",
      "analyzed the seasonality impact of the fourth quarter over each of the past\n",
      "five years, we have seen on average an increase in revenues from Q3 to Q4 of\n",
      "approximately 10%. This would suggest revenues in the range of $55 million for\n",
      "Q4.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we continue to drill down into our customer base, sales pipeline, and key\n",
      "opportunities for Q4, we see the majority of projects are expected to move\n",
      "forward as planned this quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also see, in some cases, projects that have a significant risk of being\n",
      "delayed or scaled back. A key swing factor, if the amount of yearend budget\n",
      "plush activity that happens this quarter. At this point, it is too early to\n",
      "tell how much activity and opportunity we will see in this regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we assess all of these variables, we believe that we have an opportunity to\n",
      "deliver another quarter of year-over-year growth and profitability in the\n",
      "fourth quarter; however, not at the historical Q4 growth rates that we have\n",
      "seen in the past. Specifically, we expect revenues for the fourth quarter to\n",
      "be in the range of $49 to $53 million with fully diluted earnings per share of\n",
      "$0.08 to $0.11 on a GAAP basis and $0.19 to $0.14 on a non-GAAP basis. As a\n",
      "point of comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we generated revenues of\n",
      "$50.7 million and fully diluted earnings per share of $0.11 on a GAAP basis\n",
      "and $0.13 on a non-GAAP basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In closing, I am confident that we are well positioned to continue to\n",
      "profitably grow our business in these challenging times. We will continue to\n",
      "manage our expenses smartly, making sure that we have the flexibility to run\n",
      "the business effectively in the event that external market conditions\n",
      "deteriorate further faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will also take advantage of our relative strength in this difficult\n",
      "environment by investing in more sales and engineering pallet in locations\n",
      "where we can accelerate our market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that our ability to execute on our key initiatives and continue to\n",
      "deliver superior value for our customers, will enable us to be successful in\n",
      "the near term and beyond.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Our Q3 results were in line with our guidance for the top line and exceeded\n",

      "12% over last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.46, up 11%. We generated $543 million\n",

      "this is impacting consumer spending and e-commerce growth rates, and we are\n",
      "seeing an impact across all of our platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this environment, we delivered a solid third quarter while also taking a\n",
      "number of steps to strengthen our company and better align our cost structure\n",
      "to invest and compete in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenging times create opportunities for companies that are prepared to lead\n",
      "and eBay has the global portfolio, the management discipline, and financial\n",
      "strength to take advantage of opportunities created by this period of\n",
      "challenge and uncertainty. I am confident that we will manage through this\n",
      "period and emerge an even stronger company and more formidable competitor, and\n",
      "I believe this for three simple reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we have a growing, diversified portfolio of businesses. Led by eBay and\n",
      "PayPal, we have multiple growth sources or growth engines in our company. We\n",
      "have leadership positions in e-commerce, online payments and communications,\n",
      "each with a global brand and reach. We serve hundreds of millions of users\n",
      "around the world and our proven business models generate solid revenue,\n",
      "healthy profits, and cash flow with minimum capital requirements. We have no\n",
      "inventory, no warehouses or other fixed costs that may impact many companies\n",
      "during a downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, our portfolio offers consumers and merchants real value during\n",
      "difficult times. On an unprecedented global scale, we bring people together to\n",
      "buy, sell, communicate, and be paid. For consumers looking for value, we offer\n",
      "savings through access to the most deals and biggest selection online. For\n",
      "entrepreneurs or people feeling pinched by the economy, we offer a low cost\n",
      "way to earn money and build a business. And for both consumers and merchants,\n",
      "we provide peace of mind through a low-cost, safer way to pay and be paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "And third, our company has a strong balance sheet. We have the financial\n",
      "flexibility to invest in growth, deliver on our financial commitments, and\n",
      "weather an economic downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom line is that eBay is well-positioned to compete and grow during a\n",
      "challenging and uncertain time. This is when strong companies get stronger and\n",
      "we intend to do just that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs take a greater look at the four components of our portfolio. I\n",
      "typically start with our eBay marketplace business but today I will start with\n",
      "PayPal, then our [adjacencies] and Skype, and I will end with eBay, where I\n",
      "will spend most of my time.\n",
      "\n",
      "PayPal is a great business with terrific momentum. Today PayPal generates\n",
      "about 28% of our total revenues and is well on its way to becoming more than a\n",
      "third of what we do. On eBay, PayPal's payment volume grew a healthy 12% in Q3\n",
      "and PayPal's worldwide penetration on eBay grew faster in Q3 than any quarter\n",
      "in recent years, reaching almost 60% worldwide. PayPal continues to be the\n",
      "safest way to pay and be paid on eBay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Off eBay, PayPal's growth is exploding. Merchant services total payment volume\n",
      "grew 49% in Q3 and both on and off eBay, merchants love PayPal. Why? Because\n",
      "PayPal delivers three things all merchants need -- new customers, incremental\n",
      "sales, and lower costs. And in tough economic times like this, merchants need\n",
      "PayPal more than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "And PayPal's growth shows that merchants worldwide understand this. Today more\n",
      "than a million merchants use PayPal, which is more than 65 million active user\n",
      "accounts. PayPal's global user base generates incremental business for\n",
      "merchants and an unmatched experience for consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "What excites me about PayPal, however, is not just its performance but also\n",
      "its potential. PayPal's opportunity is not just the 14% of e-commerce\n",
      "represented by the eBay marketplace. PayPal's target market goes well beyond\n",
      "that and it includes the other 86% of global e-commerce. In fact, this quarter\n",
      "for the first time the total payment volume traded through PayPal actually\n",
      "exceeded total merchandise volume traded on eBay. This simply reinforces the\n",
      "tremendous growth potential of this business. And PayPal's growth potential is\n",
      "also why we are excited about our recently announced acquisition of Bill Me\n",
      "Later, which is expected to further strengthen our position in online\n",
      "payments. With this acquisition, we will have the number one and number two\n",
      "online oriented payment brands and as I said last week, Bill Me Later brings\n",
      "complementary and reinforcing strengths to our company.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second growth engine in our portfolio is what we call our adjacencies or\n",
      "alternative e-commerce formats. These include advertising, stub hub, and\n",
      "classifieds. Together, these businesses represent about 11% of our total\n",
      "revenue and are growing faster than e-commerce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our overarching goal is to connect buyers and sellers worldwide regardless of\n",
      "format and our alternative e-commerce formats help us achieve that goal. They\n",
      "enable us to offer buyers and sellers more choice about how they want to\n",
      "trade, where they want to trade, and when they want to trade, and they do so\n",
      "in a way that is complementary to eBay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Classifieds is just one example. In just four years, we have built classifieds\n",
      "into a global business generating more than a quarter billion dollars in\n",
      "revenue with growth in Q3 of 59%, and today we have the leading classified\n",
      "position in multiple markets around the world. And our recent acquisition of\n",
      "Denmark‚Äôs leading online classified sites, DBA and BilBasen strengthens this\n",
      "position and gives us another market-leading position in Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertising is another dynamic alternative format for us. Advertising on eBay\n",
      "grew significantly in Q3 and this fall, we are launching our eBay ad commerce\n",
      "beta program for sellers in the U.S. and Germany. Sellers will now be able to\n",
      "bid for search terms and get their ads placed directly into existing ad space\n",
      "on eBay. Sellers pay only when a buyer clicks on their ad and goes to their\n",
      "listing or eBay store. This is another way we are helping sellers gain\n",
      "exposure and drive demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next part of our portfolio is Skype, which continues to show strong\n",
      "momentum. In the third quarter, registered users increased 51% over the prior\n",
      "year and Skype to Skype minutes increased 63% to 16 billion minutes,\n",
      "reflecting the power of a free voice product and a free video product in this\n",
      "challenging economy. Skype out minutes also increased 54%, which drove revenue\n",
      "growth of 46% for the quarter. Josh Silverman and his team continue to do a\n",
      "great job there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now last but not least, I would like to turn to our core eBay transaction\n",
      "business, which represents roughly half of our revenues. Clearly GMV in the\n",
      "third quarter was not what we would have liked but we remain confident in our\n",
      "overall direction and believe we are on the right path. eBay enjoys a global\n",
      "leadership position in e-commerce but buyer and seller expectations have been\n",
      "rising and we have not kept up. Thus we need to drive bold changes to continue\n",
      "our leadership position. And this is exactly what we are doing. At the\n",
      "beginning of the year, I laid out two clear priorities for our eBay business\n",
      "-- one, make eBay safer and easier to use; two, increase selection by blending\n",
      "auctions and fixed price in a uniquely eBay way.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve these goals, we have implemented two waves of changes this year.\n",
      "Frankly, some of these changes were overdue and they demonstrate our\n",
      "commitment to better meeting the expectations of sellers and buyers. And we\n",
      "are doing this in a manner which is aggressive but responsible, recognizing\n",
      "that every change we make impacts a global eco-system trading more than $60\n",
      "billion of merchandise each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recap what we have done thus far this year. First, in March we\n",
      "implemented a variety of changes geared to making eBay safer and easier to\n",
      "use. Taken together, these changes introduced incentives and rewards for\n",
      "sellers to provide both great deals but also deliver a good shopping\n",
      "experience to buyers. Are these changes working? We believe that we are\n",
      "beginning to drive a better buyer experience, a safer and easier experience on\n",
      "eBay and here‚Äôs what we see -- sellers who are meeting or exceeding buyer\n",
      "expectations are growing their businesses on eBay and more and more buyers are\n",
      "reporting positive experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take this example -- during Q3, the highest rated sellers in the U.S. saw\n",
      "their eBay businesses growth significantly. These are the sellers who buyers\n",
      "rated 4.8 or above and who have been active on eBay for more than 12 months.\n",
      "At a time when most retailers are struggling to stay even, these sellers saw\n",
      "their same-store sales on eBay grow 26% in Q3 and together they accounted for\n",
      "16% of our total GMV. And this group included both large and small sellers,\n",
      "reinforcing the fact that sellers of all sizes can succeed on eBay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, sellers with lower ratings are seeing their businesses decline. So\n",
      "we are seeing a share shift within eBay where buyers are buying more from the\n",
      "highest rated sellers and less from lower rated sellers. And not surprisingly\n",
      "the entrepreneurial eBay community, selling community is responding and the\n",
      "number of sellers earning ratings by buyers of 4.8 and above is up 20% since\n",
      "we made these changes six months ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now as I said, these are early signs and we do see buyers moving toward\n",
      "sellers with higher ratings. However, this has not yet translated into buyers\n",
      "increasing their overall purchases on eBay. This will take time, especially in\n",
      "light of the current economy, which is a mitigating factor but not an\n",
      "overriding excuse. Our current GMV trend is not where we would like it to be\n",
      "but we remain confident that the improvements we are making will ultimately\n",
      "move the needle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second major change we have announced this year was implemented in late\n",
      "September when we significantly rebalanced fees for fixed price inventory. Our\n",
      "goal is to create a marketplace that optimizes for both auctions and fixed\n",
      "price in a uniquely eBay way. We have made it virtually free for sellers to\n",
      "put fixed price inventory on eBay and we have aligned our success with theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I‚Äôm frequently asked if we are promoting fixed price at the expense of\n",
      "auctions and the answer is no. What we are doing is building a marketplace\n",
      "that lets buyers and sellers choose the format they prefer. Fixed price has\n",
      "been part of eBay for many years and we are simply improving this format as\n",
      "more and more buyers choose to purchase that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our fixed price fee changes will help improve selection and give buyers\n",
      "greater choice. Fixed price represented 46% of GMV in Q3 and grew 11% for the\n",
      "quarter, which we believe is roughly in line with e-commerce growth rates\n",
      "globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "So overall, we are driving changes to make eBay a more competitive marketplace\n",
      "in today‚Äôs environment and we are making these changes into a very challenging\n",
      "economic environment, which makes our job more difficult and lengthens the\n",
      "time it will take for progress to flow through to the financials. But we\n",
      "remain committed to reinvigorating growth in our core business and we believe\n",
      "we are on the right path.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, eBay remains the largest global marketplace with three times\n",
      "the GMV of our nearest competitor and we have important strengths in these\n",
      "uncertain times with more users, more traffic, and more successful\n",
      "transactions than any other e-commerce site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I mentioned we anticipate a very challenging fourth quarter holiday season\n",
      "where consumers will be cautious with their spending. We intend to fight\n",
      "aggressively for demand in the fourth quarter to support our sellers and\n",
      "driving demand to their great deals and great service.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we have a strong portfolio of businesses that generate growth and\n",
      "healthy returns and we believe we are well-positioned to serve consumers\n",
      "globally in tough times. We have a leading e-commerce marketplace and we are\n",
      "making the right changes to reinvigorate and strengthen eBay. PayPal has\n",
      "strong momentum as the number one online payments brand and this business will\n",
      "become even stronger following our acquisition of Bill Me Later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Classifieds, advertising, stub hub, Skype, and the rest of our portfolio are\n",
      "also strong and profitable and we will continue to drive leadership positions\n",
      "in each of these. And we will do this with our ongoing commitment to strong\n",
      "financial and operating discipline. We have the right team and we will deliver\n",
      "on our commitments while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our\n",
      "company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply put, eBay is a strong company in this environment; we intend to get\n",
      "stronger. Now let me turn it over to Bob for more details on our Q3 results.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Robert H. Swan**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, John. Now I‚Äôll review our financial performance in some detail and\n",
      "during my discussion, I‚Äôll reference our earnings slide presentation which\n",
      "accompanies the webcast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, our Q3 financial results were solid in an increasingly difficult\n",
      "environment. Revenue came in slightly below the midpoint of our guidance we\n",
      "provided in July while EPS came in significantly above our expectations.\n",
      "Revenue growth was up 12% year over year, non-GAAP earnings growth was up 11%,\n",
      "and we generated $543 million in free cash flow during the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continued to execute on our stock buy-back program, repurchasing $623\n",
      "million worth of eBay shares. Additionally, last week we announced two\n",
      "acquisitions that are intended to strengthen our faster growing businesses and\n",
      "position us competitively for the future. We also announced actions to\n",
      "simplify our organization in order to streamline decision making and reduce\n",
      "our cost structure. This will result in a charge of approximately $70 million\n",
      "to $80 million, primarily in the fourth quarter and annualized savings of\n",
      "approximately $150 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our combined businesses generated net revenues of $2.1 billion in the third\n",
      "quarter, a 12% increase over last year. Organic revenue growth excluding\n",
      "acquisitions and FX was 9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall revenue growth was enabled by high growth PayPal merchant services,\n",
      "classifieds, advertising, and Skype. Our revenue growth was negatively\n",
      "impacted throughout the quarter by the broader economic environment, as well\n",
      "as a strengthening U.S. dollar. We saw considerable slow down across virtually\n",
      "all our businesses beginning in mid-August.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-GAAP EPS was $0.46 in Q3, an 11% increase over last year and $0.05 above\n",
      "the high-end of our guidance range. Adjusted for a one-time tax gain in the\n",
      "third quarter of 2007, EPS growth would have been 24%. The stronger-than-\n",
      "expected EPS performance was primarily driven by a lower tax rate and cost\n",
      "controls as we tightened discretionary spending in light of the slowing\n",
      "economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our operating margin for the quarter was 31.8%, up 40 bps from last year even\n",
      "though our lower margin businesses, PayPal and Skype, grew faster. Margins\n",
      "improved in all three of our business segments year over year.\n",
      "\n",
      "We generated free cash flow of $543 million in the quarter, an increase of 6%\n",
      "from last year primarily driven by earnings expansion while CapEx as a\n",
      "percentage of revenues came in at 7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Return on invested capital increased to 28.8% on a trailing 12-month basis.\n",
      "This measure has shown continuous improvement over the course of the year as\n",
      "we‚Äôve been able to generate higher earnings on roughly the same level of\n",
      "capital employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "So overall we delivered solid financial results in a very tough economic\n",
      "climate. Externally, consumers are under significant pressure and appear to\n",
      "have reigned in their discretionary spending. E-commerce growth rates fell\n",
      "dramatically from Q2 to Q3. Similarly, merchants on PayPal's merchant services\n",
      "platform experienced a significant slowdown in average payment size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Internally, we experienced economic weakness across our entire portfolio of\n",
      "businesses. Vehicles GMV, which makes up 20% of total GMV, decelerated by 12\n",
      "points from Q2 to Q3 and got progressively worse throughout the quarter. Our\n",
      "non-vehicles GMV growth performed solidly in the first part of the quarter but\n",
      "started to decelerate sharply in mid-August. Similarly, we saw a significant\n",
      "slowdown at Stub Hub during the second half of the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "We haven‚Äôt yet seen any changes to these trends in our businesses early in the\n",
      "fourth quarter, which suggests we‚Äôll be operating in a difficult environment\n",
      "this holiday season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs take a closer look at our segment results -- overall our marketplace\n",
      "business segment achieved net revenues of $1.4 billion, a 4% increase over the\n",
      "year-ago period. Transaction revenue increased 1% and marketing services\n",
      "revenue increased 29% over last year. Marketplace‚Äôs revenue growth decelerated\n",
      "by nine points from Q2, primarily due to slower GMV growth and a stronger U.S.\n",
      "dollar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our online comparison site, shopping.com, was significantly impacted by\n",
      "changes made by search engines that disrupted shopping‚Äôs traffic this quarter.\n",
      "This business decelerated sharply in Q3, impacting marketplace‚Äôs revenue\n",
      "growth by about a point. We expect that shopping.com will continue to\n",
      "negatively impact our growth rate for the next three quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global GMV came in at $14.3 billion in the quarter, down 1% compared to last\n",
      "year, with both the U.S. and international geographies decelerating from last\n",
      "quarter. Global GMV growth excluding vehicles was up 3%. Active user growth\n",
      "came in at 3% on a trailing 12-month basis. Excluding China and Taiwan, where\n",
      "we are now part of joint ventures, this metric remained at 6%.\n",
      "\n",
      "We remain encouraged by strong rates of growth in our fixed price format,\n",
      "which accounted for 46% of GMV in the quarter and continues to grow much\n",
      "faster than the auction style format.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me provide a deeper look into our Q3 GMV performance. Our revised fixed\n",
      "price fee structure helped fuel a big surge in supply on our sites with\n",
      "listings growth of 26%. However, our conversion rates dropped by a sharp 18%,\n",
      "resulting in sold items growth of 6%, a four-point deceleration from Q2.\n",
      "\n",
      "We‚Äôre in the early stages of improving our finding experience and there‚Äôs\n",
      "still a bit of work to be done. We rolled out our new finding platform in the\n",
      "U.S. near the end of the third quarter, which allows us to optimize our data\n",
      "and algorithms in order to better match up buyer demand with our vast\n",
      "selection of merchandise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Average selling price continues to fall, down 7% in Q3, primarily impacted by\n",
      "the economic downturn as consumers trade down and buy fewer large ticket\n",
      "items. The combined deceleration sold items and average selling price resulted\n",
      "in GMV growth of minus 2% on an FX-neutral basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously the current GMV trend is not where we would like it to be but as\n",
      "John said, we remain confident that we are on the right path and we believe\n",
      "the improvements we are making for our users will ultimately move the needle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly the tough economy makes our job more difficult and lengthens the time\n",
      "it will take for progress to flow through to the financials but we remain\n",

      "\n",
      "As John said earlier, our adjacencies within marketplaces are characterized by\n",
      "attractive, fast-growing businesses such as classifieds, advertising, and Stub\n",

      "growth at 127%.\n",
      "\n",
      "And despite slowing during the second half of the quarter, Stub Hub increased\n",

      "Since our mid-quarter update on August 28th, the market for semiconductors and\n",
      "semiconductor capital equipment has steadily accelerated its decline. Tight\n",
      "credit markets, declining consumer demand, political uncertainty and\n",

      "semiconductor equipment business is notoriously cyclical, this is quite\n",
      "different.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a bookings front, all our regions are down. On a customer basis, there\n",
      "remain only three with the economic power to buy and less than three with the\n",
      "will to buy. The outlook right now is totally unpredictable to us. The rapid\n",
      "decline in demand for high tech gadgets, whether that decline is real or\n",
      "perceived, is causing our customers to continue a cautious stance.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a bright note, investment in advanced technology, the transition of\n",
      "aluminum to copper in memory, is continuing, but capacity expansions are\n",

      "Operationally, we continue to drive down our breakeven as our OPEX hit 105.5,\n",
      "down from a $125 million per quarter run rate in 2007. Given the uncertainty\n",
      "in the market, we're driving our cash breakeven level to approximately the\n",
      "$187 million level for quarterly revenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Jeff reported, during the quarter we remained strong on the balance sheet\n",
      "relative to our cash position. We continued to manage our assets, accounts\n",
      "receivable very carefully, with the lowest level of delinquencies that we've\n",
      "actually ever had, and we're focused on this given the climate that we're in\n",
      "today.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do have a slight increase in the inventory number, due largely to some late\n",
      "pushouts of shipments that caused finished goods to rise. We did buyback 1.4\n",
      "million shares, $28 million worth in the quarter, and yet our cash balance\n",
      "remains relatively unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now with that, I'd like to give you what we - the best we can give you at this\n",
      "time for the fourth quarter is bookings will be up 5% to down 15%. There's a\n",
      "lot of uncertainty in those numbers based on changing customer plans almost on\n",
      "a daily basis. Shipments are expected to be between $220 million and $245\n",
      "million; revenues, tracking with the shipments, about $230 million to $243\n",
      "million. Our gross margins are expected to be in the 43% to 44% range. The\n",
      "decline is due primarily to customer and product mix. And our earnings per\n",
      "share is expected to be at a breakeven basis, between minus $0.03 a share to\n",
      "plus $0.03 a share.\n",

      "\n",
      "Gross margin of 63.3% was in line with our guidance of 63% to 64% but slightly\n",

      "\n",

      "Other income in the September quarter was $8.5 million, more then $5 million\n",

      "The tipping point referred to in this article pertains to the accelerated\n",
      "displacement of [gate or] ASIC to be shortly followed by structured ASIC and\n",
      "standard cell solutions by FPGAs. This accelerating trend is fully supported\n",
      "by the widespread feedback perceived from several [turns] of customer visits I\n",
      "made this last quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely am convinced that we are at the forefront of this trend. Further\n",
      "evidence of this is in the expanding number of end markets that we service.\n",
      "Starting with wireless communications in the September quarter driven by\n",
      "strong activity in China our wireless sales increased from 11% to 15% of\n",
      "revenue.\n",

      "among the actual news affiliates.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this is speeding up the timetables for HD upgrades which work in favor\n",

      "\n",
      "This is the result of a number of factors including greater PLD cost\n",

      "As Jon mentioned we‚Äôre expecting our defense sales to be up in the December\n",

      "\n",
      "I have highlighted before this inexorable trend that we call the programmable\n",

      "statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including\n",
      "such factors among others as new orders received and shipped during the\n",
      "quarter, the timely introduction of new processes and products, and general\n",
      "conditions in the world economy and financial markets. In addition to these\n",
      "risks, which we described in our press release issued yesterday, we refer you\n",

      "questions regarding our estimated financial performance going forward.\n",
      "Consequently, should you have any questions regarding our estimates of sales\n",
      "and profits, or other financial matters for the upcoming quarter, as well as\n",
      "how they might impact our income statement model and our balance sheet, this\n",
      "is the time we are free to respond to these questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can tell from our press release there is a significant difference\n",
      "between our actual performance for the September quarter and our guidance for\n",
      "the December quarter. The company had a solid September quarter with growth in\n",
      "sales and profits. Operating income was 49% and profit before tax was 46% of\n",
      "sales. The company grew revenues for the sixth consecutive quarter and has\n",
      "continued to increase its positioning in industrial communications\n",
      "infrastructure and automotive end markets while diminishing its presence in\n",
      "margin-sensitive consumer-related end markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the extraordinary negative developments in the world-wide financial\n",
      "markets in recent weeks will undoubtedly impact business spending and\n",
      "confidence. We have already seen a slowness in our bookings in the month of\n",
      "October. How long and how deep this impact will be is very difficult to\n",
      "forecast. As managers we can control spending and deploy our talent to best\n",
      "position Linear growth and profitability when the markets return.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a reminder, in 2001 Linear managed its business through the dot-com bust.\n",
      "We remained highly profitable as a percent of sales and continued to be cash-\n",
      "flow positive. As we stated in our press release, we expect similar execution\n",
      "now and believe profit before tax, even in declining revenues, can remain\n",
      "above 40% of sales and that we can generate positive cash flow in this\n",
      "environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategically, we believe industrial communications infrastructure and\n",
      "automotive will be attractive markets, driven by the advances in\n",
      "communications capabilities, industrial innovation, and the need for energy\n",
      "and fuel efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would now like to spend a few minutes discussing the quarter we just\n",
      "completed. In a difficult economic environment, but before the financial\n",
      "markets melt-down, we had a reasonable quarter, as we grew sales, remained\n",
      "highly profitable and continued our strategic emphasis of focusing on\n",
      "traditional analog markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sales increased 1% from the previous quarter within the range of flat to 2%\n",
      "that we had forecasted in our last conference call. Revenue was $310.4\n",
      "million, up from revenue of $307.1 million for the previous quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Net income increased 4.3% and earnings per share 4.3%, also, being $0.48 up\n",
      "from $0.46 last quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a pro forma basis, without the impact of stock-based compensation, EPS\n",
      "would have been $0.53 versus $0.51 and net income would have been $118.4\n",
      "million versus $114.4 million in the June quarter. So the impact of stock-\n",
      "based compensation was 10% of net income, or $0.05 at the EPS level.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the quarter just ended our GAAP return on sales was 34.7% and our pro\n",
      "forma return on sales was 38.1%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operating income increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales,\n",
      "improving from 47.1% last quarter to 48.6% this quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gross profit decreased by 3/10 of a point, primarily due to lower ASPs\n",
      "associated with increased shipments into consumer-related markets prior to the\n",
      "holiday season. This was more than offset by a reduction in legal expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company also benefited from a discrete tax item, as the company reached a\n",
      "negotiated settlement with the IRS on the treatment of its ETI, which is\n",
      "extra-territorial income, benefits in past years. Consequently, the company‚Äôs\n",
      "tax rate for the quarter was 25%, down from its ongoing projected tax rate of\n",
      "29.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the quarter the company‚Äôs cash and short-term investments increased by\n",
      "$55.2 million, net of spending $23.1 million to purchase 737,000 shares of its\n",

      "flow from operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Board of Directors again authorized the company to pay a cash dividend of\n",
      "$0.21 per share. The dividend will be paid on November 26, 2008, to\n",
      "stockholders of record on November 14, 2008. At current stock prices this\n",
      "represents a yield of greater than 3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we continue to have an excellent business model and are therefore\n",
      "able to remain both highly profitable and cash-flow positive. Our return on\n",

      "\n",
      "In April of 2007 the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase, or\n",

      "the associated debt, has improved our returns on equity and invested capital.\n",

      "Now I would like to address the quarter‚Äôs results on a line-by-line basis,\n",
      "staring with bookings. Bookings were down marginally from the prior quarter\n",
      "and our book-to-bill ratio approximated, but did not equal, 1. Compared with\n",
      "the prior quarter, international bookings were unchanged while absorbing the\n",
      "summer vacation impact in Europe. In the USA, however, bookings were down\n",

      "Industrial and communications continue to be our largest areas. Industrial was\n",
      "previously reported at 33% of our Q4 business. This has been restated to 36%\n",
      "and the percentage for Q1 was down 1 point to 35%. This decrease is primarily\n",
      "attributable to U.S. distributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Communications, previously reported at 36%, was restated at 30% and was down\n",
      "one percentage point to 29% on a comparative basis in Q1. The major change\n",
      "between methodologies here was in the cellular handset area, which was\n",
      "restated from 11% to 7% in Q4. This change resulted from more accurate\n",
      "distributor data. Q1 at 7% was similar to Q4 restated in the handset area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going forward, we are combining communications infrastructure and networking\n",
      "as large customers are evolving to serve both of these areas. This area\n",
      "decreased marginally from 23% in Q4 to 22% in Q1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer was previously reported as 12% of our Q4 business. This has been\n",
      "restated to 10% and the percentage for Q1 rose to 12%. This area is generally\n",
      "seasonally strong going into the return-to-school and the holiday seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Automotive was previously reported as 8% of our Q4 business. This was restated\n",
      "to 9% and the percentage for Q1 was 8%. This is an area that is suffering in\n",
      "the economy now, however, given the move to more fuel-efficient vehicles, it\n",
      "is an area of emphasis for Linear. We recently introduced a part for data re-\n",

      "In addition, we continue to distinguish Linear as a high-quality supplier in\n",
      "important international manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer was previously reported as 5% of our Q4 business. This has been\n",
      "restated to 9% and the percentage rose to 10% in Q1. Certain customer\n",
      "installable automotive after-market products, such as GPS systems we believe\n",
      "more properly belong in the consumer category. This increase of 1% again\n",
      "related to product build up by customers prior to the holiday seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the military space and harsh environment products remained unchanged\n",
      "at 6% for both Q4 methodologies and for Q1.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we believe the data is now more accurate and we continue to have\n",

      "detail I‚Äôd like to highlight some of the challenges and wins of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiscal 2008 can certainly be characterized as the best of times and the worst\n",
      "of times for WD-40. We experienced the best of times with increased\n",
      "international growth our WD-40 3-In-One brands, executing on our strategy\n",
      "established back in 1998 of diversification and growth by brands, borders and\n",
      "trade shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "We faced the worst of times with continued rising costs of components and raw\n",
      "materials, sales challenges with our household cleaning brands and\n",
      "deterioration in the economic conditions in the U.S. and in some other parts\n",
      "of the world. Our people worked hard to meet the growing challenges of these\n",
      "dynamic economic times and we refined our diversification strategy to meet the\n",
      "realities of today‚Äôs market and into the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rising costs of components and raw materials is nothing new; however the\n",
      "volatility and sharp increases we experienced this year particularly in the\n",
      "fourth quarter were unexpected and unprecedented. We started the year with\n",
      "crude oil at around $83 a barrel. Oil prices peaked at $141 or above in July\n",
      "and finished the fiscal year at about $115.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you know, oil prices have an effect on oil based products, plastic\n",
      "components and cost of diesel fuel we use to transport our goods to our\n",
      "customers. Steel prices also increased dramatically with a strong demand in\n",
      "China, India and Russia and the emerging markets. WD-40 cans are manufactured\n",
      "from tin plate which increased 20% over the last two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have continuously monitored the markets and prepared our teams to respond\n",
      "and adjust to the shifts during these uncertain economic times. While we were\n",
      "able to implement cost containment and margin enhancement strategies we could\n",
      "not shield the company completely from the volatility in commodity pricing\n",
      "this past year, particularly the fourth quarter. We experienced margin erosion\n",
      "as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also experienced higher SG&A expenses which increased 7% during the fiscal\n",
      "year compared to 2008‚Äôs prior fiscal year [sic]. Our freight was up however it\n",
      "is important to note that freight costs could have been much higher if the\n",
      "company hadn‚Äôt fully implemented an integrated freight management solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes in foreign currency also contributed towards higher SG&A costs. We\n",
      "hired staff to support our growing international operations; our legal\n",
      "expenses went up due to increased activity in litigation, case load and\n",
      "increased intellectual property protection. Also impacting Q4 results was an\n",
      "impairment cost of $1.3 million or $0.05 per share on an after-tax basis\n",
      "related to the indefinite lived intangible assets of the X-14 brand. The\n",
      "impairment charge, a non-cash charge, was triggered by a decline in future\n",
      "forecast sales levels of the X-14 brand due to management‚Äôs strategic decision\n",
      "to remove a number of products from the grocery trade channel. That decision\n",
      "resulted from the company‚Äôs new diversification strategy developed during the\n",
      "fiscal year 2008. This was the first step in transitioning the brand from its\n",
      "high dependence on the grocery trade channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of these events it could be seen to be the worst of times. However,\n",
      "we do have wins to celebrate, particularly our growth in the international\n",
      "markets. As we commemorated our 53rd birthday for the first time in WD-40‚Äôs\n",
      "company history over half or 53% in fact of the company‚Äôs total revenues were\n",

      "and product sales in more detail but I‚Äôd like to highlight that we experienced\n",
      "15% growth in Europe in fiscal 2008 due to the new Smart Straw technology,\n",

      "Let me review what has occurred in the market place. As I stated before, in\n",
      "2007 and early 2008, we were dealing with a market that had excess capacity\n",
      "which resulted in downward pressure on price. Due to increased fuel prices and\n",
      "low freight demand, certain large carriers permanently reduced the size of\n",
      "their company fleets and many small carriers and single owner operators exited\n",
      "the market place causing somewhat of a reversal in capacity and the pricing\n",
      "environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Capacity tightened in the second quarter of 2008 as demand increased and\n",
      "carriers had increased pricing power. Landstar experienced the same trend\n",
      "through the month of July. July 2008 revenue increased 13% over July 2007\n",

      "September freight demand in the final weeks of the month was weaker than we\n",
      "anticipated and available to capacity appeared to have increased primarily in\n",
      "the van arena. In addition, fuel prices came down rather rapidly towards the\n",

      "\n",
      "Additionally, the third quarter of 2008 included income of approximately $0.03\n",
      "per diluted share from the bus evacuation services. Again, we had a very\n",

      "**Bertrand F. Cambou**\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a solid Q3 in spite of the challenging environment for the memory\n",
      "industry. Revenue grew to $631 million up quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year.\n",
      "These results were achieved through market share gain. We now command nearly\n",
      "40% market share compared to 33% last year and meet 20% of the formation of\n",
      "Spansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though our prices are relatively stable, we were impacted in the third\n",
      "quarter by overhead pricing pressure in the memory segment. To mitigate this\n",
      "ASP drop we are focusing on the highest margin part of the business, raising\n",
      "prices for select segments and exiting non-profitable product lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of this strategy we decided to exit the 90 nanometer content delivery\n",
      "card business in the third quarter comprised of our 4 bit [preserved] flash\n",
      "memory device built in our mature fab 25 factory. As a result of the set of\n",
      "actions that we taken, total inventories are down significantly quarter-on-\n",
      "quarter and fab 25 is essentially full. We are dedicating most of this factory\n",
      "to profitable business that we have.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the third quarter revenue generated from product built in our 300\n",
      "millimeter SP1 factory was lower than expected for the two following reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Japan cell phone business that consumed the majority of our 2 gig\n",
      "ONAND devices out of SP1 dropped in the third quarter to less than half our\n",
      "expectation. This decline was due to changes in regulation in Japan which has\n",
      "cut subsidies to subscribers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the qualifications of our 112 volt wireless NOR device to our biggest\n",
      "customer was a couple of months behind schedule. As a result revenue from SP1\n",
      "was in the low double-digit millions of dollars for the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that we were able to mitigate any potential sales impact of those\n",
      "delays by continuing shipments of the 90 nanometer NOR.\n",
      "\n",
      "Progress on customer qualifications across the board in SP1 to a full range of\n",
      "customer including our biggest NOR customer allowed us to build inventory\n",
      "ahead going into Q4. We are now on track with our SP1 factory quals including\n",
      "1.8-volt wireless NOR in our market, 3-volt customer NOR devices, MirrorBit\n",
      "clips and EcoRAM solutions. At this rate we are planning to realize full\n",
      "revenue from Sp1 productions around Q2 of 09 at which time we expect to add\n",
      "further capacity by ramping up these products at SMIC to meet customer demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me switch and explain the performance of our two main business\n",
      "divisions. The wireless system division or WSD had a strong revenue upside to\n",
      "$320 million driven by share gain at our largest OEM accounts. In fact the\n",
      "third quarter rate was the second highest quarter on report for our largest\n",
      "wireless account. Particularly strong for that division were sales in the US,\n",
      "Europe and then both Korea and China went up. Why? Japan was down for reasons\n",
      "already discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôd like to mention that quarter-on-quarter the number of units shipped in\n",
      "wireless went up by 10 million from 85 million in Q2 to 95 million in Q3.\n",
      "Interesting enough the low density least profitable segment in wireless went\n",
      "down in units quarter-on-quarter while 256 megabit and 512 megabit revenue was\n",
      "up by 33%. WSD expects significant 65 nanometer NOR revenue from Sp1 in Q4.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the consumer, set top box and industrial division or CSID revenue was\n",
      "slightly down to a respectable $305 million. We are again very pleased with\n",
      "the performance of this division.\n",
      "\n",
      "Year-to-date CSID has enjoyed very large segment share gain leveraging high\n",
      "density MirrorBit devices. Quarter-on-quarter revenue from high density\n",
      "MirrorBit product in that division greater than 128 megabit went up 7% while\n",
      "the last profitable commodity floating gate product went down.\n",
      "\n",
      "CSID is now going also full speed in qualifying 65 nanometer NOR from SP1. We\n",
      "expect revenue for that division this quarter as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deployment of our newly-announced EcoRAM technology for data center and\n",
      "search engine is right on time. We now have our first server in the hand of\n",
      "our customer and expect firm orders this quarter. EcoRAM will be built in SP1\n",
      "first and also SMIC for additional capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also note that last month we announced the extension of our agreement with\n",
      "SMIC to include our new 43 nanometer MirrorBit ORNAND2 out of the Wuhan XinXin\n",

      "\n",
      "Before I let Dario describe our financials in detail, I‚Äôd like to give a brief\n",
      "update on cost-cutting and restructuring efforts. This morning we announced a\n",
      "very significant MOU, Memorandum of Understanding, for the creations of a\n",
      "joint venture with ASE group to jointly own and operate Spansion‚Äôs flagship\n",
      "Suzhou factory. This factory has 1,100 employees dedicated to assembly and\n",
      "test mainly for cell phone memory multichip modules. The purpose of the\n",
      "alliance is to leverage ASE‚Äôs expertise and economy of scale to further\n",
      "accelerate our cost advantage over our competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are currently in discussions with other potential partners to create\n",
      "similar arrangements for other final manufacturing facilities and material\n",
      "with the fabrications. We are also making progress in forging alliances with\n",
      "other leading corporations to reduce our R&D costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Altogether we are now on the path to create a focused Spansion while\n",
      "leveraging our high valued $2.3 billion of fixed assets that we own as well as\n",
      "our very strong intellectual property, which approximately count 3,000 patents\n",
      "and patent applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "To notice that short-term we are taking more actions to rapidly cut all\n",
      "spending and reduce the need for cash. This includes salary reductions,\n",
      "cutting capital expenditures, freezing headcount and reducing administrative\n",
      "expenses. In manufacturing we are engaged in a relentless race to cut subcon\n",
      "and foundry expenses and push for productivity in all areas. As a result costs\n",
      "went down in Q3 and I expect them to decline further this quarter and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I‚Äôd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Dario Sacomani.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dario Sacomani**\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôll review a few specifics of our financial performance for the quarter and\n",
      "then I‚Äôll provide some detail on our outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Bertrand mentioned, Q3 was solid in light of the overall memory segment.\n",
      "Net sales in Q3 were $631 million, up 3% compared to Q2. Overall pricing was\n",
      "stable in the third quarter which contrasts sharply with the rest of the flash\n",
      "memory industry. Sequentially from Q2 ASP per megabit declined approximately\n",
      "10%. However in our core NOR business it was only 8% to 9% ASP per megabit\n",
      "decline. Therefore, overall I‚Äôm pleased with the relative stability in our\n",
      "core NOR business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest impact on margins this quarter was from our 90 nanometer content\n",
      "delivery business which we decided to exit in Q3. Even with these lower ASPs\n",
      "we were able to grow the top line. As for gross margin, there were three\n",
      "primary drivers regarding third quarter margin of 14%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core NOR pricing decline of 8% to 9% I mentioned caused about a 150 basis\n",
      "point incremental gross margin decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the third quarter Spansion elected to exit the 90 nanometer content\n",
      "delivery business as Bertrand mentioned by monetizing the inventory and\n",
      "writing down certain related assets. With mainstream NAND price declines of\n",
      "over 40% since the third quarter alone, we made the decision to exit this\n",
      "business which cost us about 200 basis points of gross margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, gross margin was also impacted by approximately 150 basis points due\n",
      "to lower-than-expected SP1 utilization as explained previously by Bertrand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the volatile economic environment our outlook for Q4 gross margin is\n",
      "uncertain. Our current expectation is that gross margin in Q4 will be up but\n",
      "could be flat depending on how demand for Q4 and Q109 affects factory\n",
      "utilization through the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the expense side, excluding restructuring charges, op ex totaled $171\n",
      "million down $6 million sequentially and slightly better than our expectation.\n",
      "Our outlook for the fourth quarter for ongoing operating expenses is a further\n",
      "decline of approximately $10 million reflecting the impact of cost reduction\n",
      "measures implemented in the third quarter as Bertrand discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we are successful with certain partnerships and restructuring activities,\n",
      "we may have additional expenses associated with those transactions. We expect\n",
      "to see additional savings from restructuring initiatives next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on you‚Äôll note an uptick in our income tax provision in Q3 due to more\n",
      "profit in our Japan subsidiary. We expect future provisions to be in the range\n",
      "of $3 million to $5 million per quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Net loss for the quarter was $119 million or $0.74 a share and included $13\n",
      "million in charges related to our exit of the 90 nanometer content delivery\n",
      "business. EBITDA for the quarter was $76 million and included the $13 million\n",
      "of exit costs and a small restructuring charge of $1 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the balance sheet, DSOs were up slightly to 57 days from 55 in\n",
      "Q2. Days payable declined to 104 from 111. Inventory days were 103 down from\n",
      "115 in Q2 reflecting results from our overall inventory reduction plan\n",
      "including continued reduction of external foundry and subcon support of\n",
      "approximately $15 million. We expect the inventory to decline slightly in Q4.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of Q3 our cash and short-term investment balances were $259\n",
      "million. This amount included $107 million of auction rate securities which we\n",
      "temporarily impaired from $122 million or 88% of PAR. Last week UBS offered to\n",
      "buy-back these securities at 100% of PAR in June of 2010. From now until then\n",
      "we might be able to receive 75% of the PAR value of these notes in the form of\n",
      "a short-term loan against these securities at the same interest rate we are\n",
      "currently earning on these securities. We are currently working with UBS to\n",
      "realize this liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to our cash and investments, revolver capacity at the end of the\n",
      "quarter was approximately $100 million bringing total liquidity to $359\n",
      "million. The ASE transaction discussed by Bertrand should result in cash\n",
      "proceeds to Spansion, and we have several other similar opportunities that we\n",
      "are pursuing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cap ex for the third quarter was $110 million, flat from last quarter. The\n",
      "majority of the cap ex spend in the quarter was 65 nanometer and 45 nanometer\n",
      "300 millimeter development. Now that the initial investment in SP1 is complete\n",
      "we‚Äôre significantly reducing our capital spending to maintenance levels. For\n",
      "Q4 we expect capital expenditures to be roughly $40 million. Our previous\n",
      "outlook for 2008 was cap ex to be under $500 million so with this reduction we\n",
      "are now expecting approximately $435 million of capital expense for the year.\n",
      "That excludes the $50 million lease in Q1 bringing full year to $485 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, our sales growth in the quarter was impressive considering the\n",
      "memory market conditions, our inventory levels are moving in the right\n",
      "direction, we remain cautious in this environment and are taking aggressive\n",
      "actions to align our operations accordingly to ensure our long-term success.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that I‚Äôll pass it back to Bertrand to wrap up.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bertrand F. Cambou**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me wrap up and come back again on our guidance. We are very confident in\n",
      "our ability to solidify our segment market share position in Q4 as we are\n",
      "ramping up a new wireless account and pushing high density MirrorBit across\n",
      "all businesses. However we have to carefully consider the uncertainty in our\n",
      "business. The size of the total available market may actually shrink and we\n",
      "will offset this reduction somewhat by gaining share. Altogether we are now\n",
      "thinking about a slight reduction of revenue in Q4. Dario has already said\n",
      "gross margin at that point to be flat to up and all of our expenses to go\n",
      "down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me assure you that the primary objective of management in this difficult\n",
      "environment is: First, cash preservation and the relentless cost-cutting\n",
      "effort. Second, we are pursuing a successful commercial strategy to gain\n",
      "share, a strategy to count. And third, we are focused on a flawless execution\n",
      "at SP1 to fully leverage this strategic asset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spansion‚Äôs competitive position significantly improved again in Q3 and our\n",

      "the quarter before I turn the call over to Hamish for a detailed overview of\n",
      "our financials.\n",
      "\n",
      "We experienced a 16% growth in net sales during this period over the prior\n",

      "across all of our segments women‚Äôs, men‚Äôs, international and kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we had projected on previous calls our growth margin continues to trend\n",

      "\n",
      "During the quarter net sales grew to $18.2 million from $15.7 million over the\n",
      "prior year period. A 16% increase as Marc noted. Overall sales growth was\n",
      "primarily attributable to strong performance across all of our segments as\n",
      "follows. First, our women‚Äôs domestic department store business had a 24% gross\n",
      "sales increase over Q307.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notable accounts that grew included Saks by 81%, Macy's West by 32%, Macy's\n",
      "Central by 422% and One Male by 38%. We experienced this increase due to new\n",
      "door growth. However, this strong growth in women‚Äôs department store business\n",
      "was partly offset by a 14% decline in our gross sales in our women‚Äôs specialty\n",
      "store business over Q307. Due to the promotional department store environment\n",
      "many of our specialty stores made more conservative purchases over the summer\n",
      "months.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we saw solid increases with such notable accounts as Anthropology,\n",
      "Barney‚Äôs, Henry Bendel, American Rag, National Jeans Co., and some other\n",
      "regional specialty store chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, our men‚Äôs domestic business had a 67% increase in gross sales for the\n",
      "quarter. Men‚Äôs department store sales saw a 79% increase compared to a year\n",
      "ago. Notable accounts showing solid growth over last year were Macy‚Äôs West by\n",
      "132%, Bloomingdale‚Äôs by 104% and Nordstrom‚Äôs by 34%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding men‚Äôs specialty sales we are pleased to report that this segment was\n",

      "\n",
      "Finally our international business recorded gross sales of approximately $1.9\n",

      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Our gross margins came in at 49% during the quarter due to a greater quantity\n",
      "of our production being sought from outside of the United States. During the\n",
      "quarter our non-U.S. production accounted for 86% of all approved shipped\n",
      "compared to 79% shipped in the second quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third quarter SG&A was $6.1 million a 15% increase from $5.3 million a year\n",

      "you an overview, and Parker, as I said, will give you all the details behind\n",
      "the numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, we approved an increase in our distribution per unit to $1.02 or $4.08\n",
      "annualized. That's up from $0.99 last quarter, and it represents a 16%\n",
      "increase over the third quarter of 2007 distribution which was $0.88 or $3.52\n",
      "annualized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably a more important number is distributable cash flow per unit before\n",
      "certain items this quarter was $1.09. That's up 14% from the $0.96 per unit\n",
      "for the comparable period last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through nine months of 2008, Kinder Morgan has now produced distributable cash\n",
      "flow of $856 million. That's up 37% from about $623 million for the same nine\n",
      "months last year. I think it's also important to point out that the excess of\n",
      "distributable cash flow before certain items above that distribution for the\n",
      "first three quarters was about $97 million. Or put another way, our\n",
      "distributions per unit have gone to $297 million for the first three quarters\n",
      "of 2008 versus $256 million for the first three quarters of 2007. And even\n",
      "with that increase, we still accumulated excess cash flow of $97 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a strong third quarter, despite really a lost business associated with\n",
      "the two hurricanes that was about $21.5 million that we add in our segment\n",
      "results. We had decreased demand from gas... for gasoline during the quarter.\n",
      "We had a dreadful economy. We had increases in construction and fuel costs\n",
      "that impacted both our existing operations and our capital expansion program.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you look at all this and certainly while we face our share of headwinds\n",
      "on a going forward basis, I think these results demonstrate that our\n",
      "diversified portfolio, a very stable assets is capable of generating\n",
      "consistently strong cash flow, even in these extremely difficult market\n",
      "conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results that we produced during the quarter and really for the year-to-\n",
      "date were led by three of our segments: our CO2 segment, our Natural Gas\n",
      "Pipelines and our Terminals segments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me start with an overview of the Products Pipelines. We had earnings\n",
      "before DD&A of about $141 million. That's down about $14 million or 9% from a\n",
      "year ago. Of course, we had the North System in our numbers during the third\n",
      "quarter a year ago. And if you exclude that, it had roughly $11 million of\n",
      "earnings before DD&A in the third quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you exclude that, we were down about $4 million from a year ago. Virtually\n",
      "all of that had been... some was at SFPP where we had lower throughput. SFPP\n",
      "was off about $9 million from a year ago. The rest of the group made up about\n",
      "$5 million of the shortfall. So we were down about $4 million from a year ago\n",
      "or about 3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The downturn of SFPP is overwhelmingly attributable to just lower throughput\n",
      "on our system out on the West Coast. We did have improved results in this\n",
      "segment by our Southeast Terminals, our West Coast Terminals and our Central\n",
      "Florida Pipeline when you compare to the third quarter of 2007. Those groups\n",
      "of assets benefited as we had some upgrades and modifications of our\n",
      "facilities which enabled us to generate more revenues by handling more\n",
      "ethanol. That's become a nice return benefit for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you look at the total refined products revenues for the quarter, they were\n",
      "flat. The volumes were down about 7.9% compared to the same period a year ago.\n",
      "If you strip out the hurricane impact on volumes, it was about 6.9% down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the nine months of 2008, products revenues are actually up a little\n",
      "less than 2%, volumes down a little more than 7%, some mix pretty much down\n",
      "across the country. Las Vegas and all places are still positive both for the\n",
      "quarter and the year by about 1%. And the gasoline volumes in the Central\n",
      "Florida, around Orlando looked like they're down but actually Florida mandated\n",
      "10% ethanol this year. So, quarter-on-quarter, we're down by probably about 2%\n",
      "or 3% in the Central Florida. So, those are isolated pockets where demand for\n",
      "gasoline still seems to be pretty strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, they had third quarter segment\n",
      "earnings before DD&A and certain items of $177 million. That's up 25% from\n",
      "$142 million in the third quarter of last year. And the results there were\n",
      "driven by two things. We had a nice return from our Rockies Express project,\n",
      "compared to last year, plus about $23 million for the quarter even after\n",
      "taking into account the hydrostatic testing that we had during the month of\n",
      "September which shut a big portion of REX down for most of that month.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the Texas Intrastate Pipeline Group continues to perform very well.\n",
      "It was up $14 million quarter-over-quarter. And the same trend lines are\n",
      "really positive for the year as a whole. It's important to note that again,\n",
      "there was some negative from the hurricanes in this business segment also at\n",
      "our Intrastate pipelines, a little less than $4 million of negative impact\n",
      "from the hurricanes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our CO2 segment delivered third quarter segment earnings before DD&A of $203\n",
      "million. That was up 47% from the $138 million a year ago. And that segment\n",
      "sustained about $11 million of lost business as a result of hurricane Ike. And\n",
      "you may wonder why does the CO2 business... that's primarily operational in\n",
      "Colorado, New Mexico and Western Texas. Why would it have a decrease as a\n",
      "result of hurricane Ike. And the reason is that we had a decrease in NGL sales\n",
      "volumes due to third-party fractionation facilities being shut down. Now this\n",
      "will continue, we think, into early November when the main fractionator of our\n",
      "largest customer is scheduled to start up at the Volmont [ph] refinery\n",
      "complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "So even overcoming this $11 million, they had a very good quarter in the CO2\n",
      "segment. And that was driven by a little bit stronger than expected oil\n",
      "production at the SACROC Unit by increased CO2 sales and transport volumes and\n",
      "by higher hedge prices and higher oil and CO2 prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the important statistics, I think, in CO2 is the fact that our average\n",
      "oil production for the quarter at SACROC was just short of 28,000 barrels per\n",
      "day, up about 2% from the same period last year. Our average oil production at\n",
      "Yates was just a little over 27,000 barrels a day, a flat with the third\n",
      "quarter of 2007, and our CO2 delivery volumes were up 14% compared to third\n",
      "quarter of last year. And that's due to the expansion projects in the\n",
      "Southwest Colorado that are virtually complete and that have increased our CO2\n",
      "production that we can move down to the Permian Basin across our Cortez\n",
      "Pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now expect our CO2 production... I mean our oil production at SACROC and\n",
      "Yates, both to be slightly above our plan for the year, and I think that's a\n",
      "promising outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "And our Terminals segment, their third quarter earnings before DD&A and\n",
      "certain items was $132.4 million. That's up about 21% from year ago. The great\n",
      "bulk of that growth came from organic opportunities or organic expansions with\n",
      "the other 25% attributable to acquisitions. The expansions that resulted in\n",
      "internal growth included pretty major expansions at our large liquids\n",
      "terminals on the Houston Ship Channel in New York Harbor, at our North 40\n",
      "Terminal near Edmonton, in Alberta, Canada and our Vancouver Wharves terminal,\n",
      "in Vancouver British Columbia. They also faced some hurricane damage as part\n",
      "of this $21.5 million I referenced earlier. And their damage was about $6.3\n",
      "million in terms of lost business during the third quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total bulk tonnage was up about 9% for the quarter compared to the third\n",
      "quarter of 2007, led primarily by strong coal volumes at several of our\n",
      "terminals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our fifth business segment, Kinder Morgan Canada, which we formerly referred\n",
      "to as Trans Mountain, had DD&A of about $40 million, up 79% from the same\n",
      "period a year ago. And those results primarily reflect completion of the first\n",
      "portion of the Anchor Loop expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline. So, we\n",
      "were able to boost the throughput capacity of Trans Mountain from 260,000\n",
      "barrels a day in the third quarter a year ago to 285,000 barrels per day now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final phase of that expansion is now coming on service. It will be online\n",
      "by November 1st, just a few days ahead of our plan. And we'll take the\n",
      "capacity up to 300,000 barrels per day and certainly to increase earnings and\n",
      "cash flow at Kinder Morgan Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me talk about the outlook. You'll notice, those of you who read the\n",
      "press release carefully that last quarter we had said we expected to exceed\n",
      "our target of $4.02 in distribution. I remember through the first three\n",
      "quarters were $2.97, so just to meet the $4.02 would mean $0.05 in\n",
      "distribution per unit in the fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last quarter, we said we expected to exceed that target. We now say we expect\n",
      "to meet or exceed that target. Let me explain that.\n",
      "\n",
      "We still expect our distribution... our distributable cash flow per unit to\n",
      "substantially exceed the $4.02 target that we have for the year but given the\n",
      "hurricane impact in the third quarter and additional impact of probably in the\n",
      "neighborhood of $10 million or a little more in the fourth quarter, we're\n",
      "going to wait for the fourth quarter results to see just how much excess\n",
      "coverage we want and is appropriate for the fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we'll either meet or exceed our target and we will post you on that\n",
      "obviously at the end of this quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me talk about some of our major projects, which a good part of the\n",
      "press release is devoted to. Now a lot of these projects are coming in on time\n",
      "and on budget, particularly on our Products Pipeline and Terminals segment.\n",
      "But if we do face continued cost escalation on some of our major pipeline\n",
      "projects in the natural gas segment, as is due to additional regulatory\n",
      "requirements put on us, additional and rising construction and material costs,\n",
      "of weather delays, among other things. We remain extremely focused on managing\n",
      "these increases and on identifying ancillary opportunities to offset them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our total forecast of capital expenditures on our major projects are now up\n",
      "about 22% from the numbers we shared with you at our January investor\n",
      "conference. Most of that increase in the last quarter, as I said, has been on\n",
      "our major natural gas pipeline projects and why we would rather not see these\n",
      "increases obviously. We remain confident that large projects like Rockies\n",
      "Express and Midcontinent Express will still deliver attractive returns to our\n",
      "investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we've said before, when we evaluate these projects at the get-go in order\n",
      "to make capital investment decisions, we conservatively estimate cash flows\n",
      "which leads to a lot of opportunities to outperform. To give you one example,\n",
      "on REX, we're already providing ancillary services to our shippers which\n",
      "generate revenues well in excess of the contractual revenues on which we base\n",
      "our expected return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I will say that on our Kinder Morgan Louisiana System, that does not look\n",
      "like an attractive return at this time. We're working very hard to improve the\n",
      "revenue line on that project, and we're actually finding some opportunities to\n",
      "do exactly that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we've described a whole bunch of our projects and acquisitions in our\n",
      "earnings release. So I'm not going to go through all of them. You can read\n",
      "them yourselves. But I do want to mention just three of the newer ones that\n",
      "have occurred since the last time we spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first is that we announced today that we've entered into a purchase and\n",
      "sale agreement to buy a liquids terminal in Phoenix, Arizona from\n",
      "ConocoPhillips for about $29 million. This is a liquids facility that has tank\n",
      "capacity of about 200,000 barrels per day. It's located adjacent to our... the\n",
      "existing terminal in the Phoenix complex. It will increase our storage\n",
      "capacity in that market by about 13%. We expect to close that in early\n",
      "December. It will be immediately accretive to cash flow available for\n",
      "distribution to our unitholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also... since we last talked, have announced a new $1.3 billion natural gas\n",
      "pipeline project together with Energy Transfer Partners. We announced that on\n",
      "October 1, and that's the Fayetteville Express Project. It's a 42 inch, 187\n",
      "mile pipeline that will begin in Conway, Arkansas and end in Quitman County,\n",
      "Mississippi. We have ten-year binding commitments that now total a 1.85\n",
      "billion cubic feet per day out of the initial capacity of 2 billion cubic feet\n",
      "per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pending regulatory approvals we expect to be in service by late 2010 or early\n",
      "2011. And we expect all of that capacity to be fully committed prior to the\n",
      "time that we begin construction on the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, since we last talked, KMP acquired two pipeline systems from\n",
      "Knight Inc., the private entity which owns a general partner of KMP. That\n",
      "purchase includes Knight's one-third interest in the Express-Platte crude oil\n",
      "pipeline systems that runs from Alberta Canada down to Illinois and a jet fuel\n",
      "pipeline that serves the Vancouver British Columbia Airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "KMP paid now at approximately 2 million KMP units. So, it's all equity\n",

      "but well above or really favorable to the budget for the nine months and we\n",
      "expect that overall for the year, essentially a function of rates being lower\n",

      "\n",
      "Minority interest is essentially unchanged. Certain items are laid out below\n",

      "Legal reserves and settlements, you'll see about $9.5 million for the quarter.\n",
      "That's largely related to a settlement of FFPP rates. And this amount relates\n",

      "item. Below that mark-to-market has certain upstream hedges. It's a positive\n",

      "were deemed ineffective in the second quarter. We had a charge that showed up\n",
      "in certain items at that point in time. And we said at that time in July that\n",
      "we would expect positive amounts to flow back through to offset that over the\n",
      "next few quarters. Well this is the biggest piece of it, and so you see it's\n",
      "over $12 million. And if you look the year-to-date on that line, it's negative\n",
      "about $900,000. So almost everything that showed up there in the second\n",
      "quarter has now come back to us. And really all we did is just didn't change\n",
      "for how we account or really how things flow in terms of cash up at the\n",
      "segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hurricanes and fires, you will see a $15.5 million charge there for the\n",
      "quarter. What this represents are asset write-offs, and so assets that are on\n",
      "our books that were destroyed or otherwise hurt in the hurricane and then one-\n",
      "time expenses associated with the hurricanes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now these amounts will clearly be offset in the future by insurance\n",
      "recoveries. And when they are, those insurance recoveries have to be accounted\n",
      "for as a gain at that point in time. And that gain will show up down here in\n",
      "certain items. So again, expect a positive to come in the future that will\n",
      "offset these amounts. Now it won't offset the full amounts because we do have\n",
      "deductibles associated with our insurance programs. Other or a few smaller\n",
      "items and then minority interest are... the minority interest amounts that are\n",
      "associated with those certain items.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really, that takes you back down to net income, which once you flow that\n",
      "through, the depreciation, the book and cash taxes and the sustaining capital\n",
      "expenditures, you get to your DCF before certain items $282 million for the\n",
      "quarter or $1.9 hub [ph] or in our $1.2 distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Briefly, I will go back to the first page, which is again the face of the\n",
      "income statement. I don't think that there is a whole lot meaningful in the\n",
      "face of the income statement. There are certain items that are scattered\n",
      "throughout there that we pull out and identify for you on the second page. So\n",
      "I think that's a more meaningful way to look at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will point out that there is a new section. It's the bottom section of that\n",
      "page. Segment earnings before DD&A and amortization of excess investments.\n",
      "This is basically segment earnings before DD&A including certain items. And so\n",
      "you can compare it to the segment earnings before DD&A at the top of the next\n",
      "page, which excludes certain items. And again, the certain items are all\n",
      "identified down below. We do believe how we represent it on the second page is\n",
      "the appropriate way to look at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean I will say that if you look at it on the first page, you would think\n",
      "that our growth is even stronger than what we are claiming. If you look at the\n",
      "segment earnings before DD&A on the first page, you'd say total segments are\n",
      "up 29%. We would argue they are only up 22%. And if you look for the nine\n",
      "months, you'd say they are up almost 69%. And we're telling you they are\n",
      "really only up 29%. Again, we believe the way that it is represented on the\n",
      "second page is the correct way to look at it and to understand what these\n",
      "assets are going to generate going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now before I go to the balance sheet, a couple of quick comments about the\n",
      "fourth quarter. Again, as Rich said, we expect to meet or exceed our budget of\n",
      "$4.02\n",
      "\n",
      "of distribution for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have generated $97 million of excess cash flow through the first three\n",
      "quarters due primarily to two factors. We actually think that that excess cash\n",
      "flow will come down when we finish the year, meaning that we won't finish with\n",
      "$97 million of excess cash flow; we'll finish with something less. And so what\n",
      "that implies is that in the fourth quarter, there will not be excess coverage,\n",
      "but rather, we won't fully cover the distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the reasons for that are really two items that I have already discussed.\n",
      "One is the shifting of sustaining capital expenditures from the first three\n",
      "quarters into the fourth quarter. Now again, that number will be consistent\n",
      "with our budget, but it will be higher in the fourth quarter than what we\n",
      "expected. And then the second issue is continued impact of the hurricanes,\n",
      "which we currently estimate to be about $11.5 million, and that's due to the\n",
      "lower NGL volumes of CO2 and a little bit of continued impact at the terminal.\n",
      "\n",
      "So again what I'm saying is we don't expect to end the year at a full $97\n",
      "million of excess coverage. We do expect that we will have significant excess\n",
      "coverage above our distribution. And so when you look at it for the full year,\n",
      "we will have very significant excess coverage and will be well above our\n",
      "budget now in terms of excess coverage for the entire year.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, I will go to the balance sheet, which should be the last page\n",
      "attached to the press release and walk down that quickly. Our cash and cash\n",
      "equivalents haven't changed, other current assets essentially unchanged. PP&E\n",
      "is up, largely the assumption of expansion CapEx. Investments are up. That's\n",
      "largely a result of the investment in Rockies Express from earlier this year\n",
      "and the dropdown of Express which is equity accounted for, so it shows up on\n",
      "this line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now reducing those amounts was the sale of Thunder Creek, which was also\n",
      "accounted for as an equity investment and then the credit facility that we've\n",
      "put in place at Midcontinent Express around the return of cash from\n",
      "Midcontinent Express earlier in the year. And so that's reduced the amounts on\n",
      "this line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deferred charges and other assets is up about $200 million. Part of that is\n",
      "the note that we now have as part of our investment in Express and then the\n",
      "other part is just the mark-to-market of our hedges that just flow through the\n",
      "balance sheet. Total assets now about $17 billion. Notes payable and current\n",
      "maturities, I will talk about that when I talk about total debt. Other current\n",
      "liabilities essentially unchanged. Long-term debt, again, I will get to that\n",
      "in a minute. Value of interest rate swaps just a function of the forward curve\n",
      "for interest rates. Other is up about $200 million. That again is the hedge\n",
      "balance sheet mark-to-market. Minority interest unchanged. Accumulated other\n",
      "comprehensive loss, you will see it is up from the end of 2007. It is down\n",
      "significantly from where it was at the end of June. Some of you may recall or\n",
      "go back and look, we were at $2.95 billion at the end of June; now we are at\n",
      "$1.5 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "So significant reduction, which is just a function of commodity prices during\n",
      "the third quarter. Other partners' capital is up as a function of issuing\n",
      "equity and then a little bit because of the Express transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "So taking a step down to total debt, you see we are a little under $8.3\n",
      "million of total debt. That's up from about $7 billion [ph] at the end of 2010\n",
      "and up a little bit from about $8 billion at the end of the second quarter.\n",
      "\n",

      "through your budgeting process for the forward 12 months. When you include the\n",
      "projects like the Fayetteville line, can you give us some insight as to your\n",

      "2009 versus 2010. We have a good handle on the total costs and have locked in.\n",

      "I don't... cost capital itself doesn't actually impact your return. I mean, I\n",
      "think the objective is to ensure that your earnings return that is well in\n",
      "excess of your cost of capital. And clearly, we believe that we are doing that\n",
      "just as we have historically. I mean, I think everyone who follows us, is\n",
      "probably sick of hearing that we're going to say this but we have never done\n",
      "projects that were right on top of our capital. We have always, whenever we\n",
      "were going to do a project, looked for a nice cushion between the return that\n",
      "we expected from that projects and our cost of capital. And I think we also\n",
      "very conservatively estimate cash flows from our projects. And I think we are\n",
      "seeing that on Rockies Express as portions of it come online, we are able to\n",
      "generate more cash than we have in our projection. So remain very confident\n",

      "\n",
      "Park, let ask you a follow-up question because you touched on something that I\n",

      "at your budgeting process towards the end of '07 and early '08, can you just\n",
      "help us understand what... the spread above your cost of capital, what target\n",
      "return on average you were looking for and how that may be changing now in\n",
      "this environment as you look at the forward 12 months?\n",
      "\n",
      "**C. Park Shaper - President**\n",
      "\n",
      "Well I guess what I would say is in this environment where capital is more\n",
      "scarce, no question and where cost of debt is backed up, cost of equity is\n",
      "backed up. And I think what that leads to is less competition for a number of\n",
      "these projects. We will be doing all that we can to lock in higher returns on\n",

      "\n",
      "**Darren Horowitz - Raymond James**\n",

      "Okay, let me switch gears. When you talked about obviously maintaining a more\n",

      "look at the year ahead, how do you balance excess cash flow coverage versus\n",
      "bottom line DCF growth?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Richard D. Kinder - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Well I think it is a balancing process and we're just going to look at that.\n",
      "Our commitment for the last 12 years has been, and that's consistent with the\n",
      "MLP rules, that we try to pass on to our unit holders the overwhelming bulk of\n",
      "the cash that we generate after debt service and all other costs. Clearly, I\n",
      "think we'll continue with an eye looking at the... we are entitled to maintain\n",
      "excess coverage for purposes of setting up reserves and for future capital\n",
      "needs. And I think we'll look at that very carefully as a balancing process\n",
      "when we set our targets for distributions in 2009. And now course I think\n",
      "something that ought to give all of you comfort, as you know, at our January\n",
      "conference, we will spell out in detail what we expect our distributable cash\n",
      "flow per unit to be and then how much we expect to distribute and what our\n",
      "target is for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll see all of that and then in addition, I guess I would mention that the\n",
      "past does not necessarily prologue the future. But in the past, and Park\n",
      "alluded to this earlier, we've almost always ended up with more excess\n",
      "coverage. We've met or exceeded our targeted distribution every year in the\n",
      "existence of this company except for one year... and missed by $0.02 in 2006.\n",
      "But every year but that one year, we have had excess coverage that generally\n",
      "has been greater once we total up the whole year than what we projected in\n",
      "January at our analyst conference. So that gives us a little bit of comfort on\n",
      "running RIM [ph]. But,certainly we will look at that. And we are not na√Øve. I\n",
      "mean, clearly, in this kind of environment something you need to be looking at\n",
      "is that what ratio of excess coverage is appropriate in this kind of\n",
      "environment. And that's what we are going to look at on a going forward basis.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Richard D. Kinder - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer**\n",

      "priced asset. We believe in it 101%. And we're just going to look at the\n",

      "\n",
      "And we'll just let that be our guideline and we are very clear with the Board\n",
      "that we'll just evaluate that on an ongoing basis. We have absolutely no\n",
      "immediate need for any cash, debt or equity. We've told you what our credit\n",
      "facilities are at the end of the year even after all of the funds that we\n",
      "expect to spend in the fourth quarter on these projects. And even assuming no\n",
      "term up of debt, no issuance of equity whatsoever in the fourth quarter. So,\n",
      "we'll just watch it on a month-by-month basis, looking at the market on both\n",
      "the debt and equity side, and decide when we want to use that $750 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's a little everything we tell you about Knight, obviously John is a\n",
      "matter of public record and our securities tonnage of Knight but Knight after\n",
      "the sell-out of NGPL of course is a very under levered company and it's shown\n",
      "by the fact that the debt to EBITDA ratio is about 2.6 times.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have an undrawn credit facility at Knight. We have a credit facility of $1\n",

      "we do have a final tax payment on the NGPL sale that will come up right after\n",
      "the first of the year of little over $200 million. So say it in round figure,\n",
      "750 to 800 of undrawn facility, plus again we have all the cash flow coming in\n",
      "at Knight for next year. We had EBITDA of over $1 billion this year. We'd\n",

      "ethanol pipelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Richard D. Kinder - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's a very good question. The tests on our central Florida pipeline\n",
      "went very well. We are going to start offering that to our customers later in\n",
      "the fourth quarter and we seem to have an awful lot of pent up demand for that\n",
      "given the fact that the 10% Florida mandate now for ethanol. And right now of\n",
      "course we have the terminal in Tampa, the terminal in Orlando and the pipeline\n",
      "connecting the two. But right now, for the ethanol part of the demand, that\n",
      "10% is being moved until we started this magic [ph] by truck from Tampa over\n",
      "to Orlando, then put into tanks at our Orlando terminal and blended in at the\n",
      "rack to produce the 10% mandated ethanol content. Certainly, it's much cheaper\n",
      "to ship by pipeline even over this relatively short distance than it is to\n",
      "ship by truck. So we think people are definitely going to take advantage of\n",
      "all we can offer them on batching ethanol in Florida.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the next one that comes to mind is we have a pipeline system in Oregon,\n",
      "part of SFPP that runs from Portland down to Eugene, Oregon, and we would\n",
      "think that's probably the next place that we will implement this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now beyond that, on the long haul pipes, it's more difficult. We are looking\n",
      "at how we do this, but I certainly would not want to promise that we'll be\n",
      "batching major quantities of ethanol on plantation or on the two major\n",
      "facilities on SFPP, the east line and west line. What I would say though is\n",
      "that we've said this before on plantation, there may be the opportunity. We\n",
      "have multiple lines running across the Southeast. There may be the opportunity\n",
      "to segregate out ethanol, take one of those smaller lines and put it in\n",
      "ethanol service on a going forward basis. And certainly that's easier to do\n",
      "than batching ethanol, but some of the same technology making sure that you've\n",
      "got the moisture out of the system, et cetera, et cetera that we've learned on\n",
      "Florida will apply if we wanted to dedicate part of the plantation system to\n",
      "ethanol. And that's something we'll continue to look at, and I think it will\n",
      "probably be early 2009 before we're prepared to address that in more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "But clearly ethanol movement by pipeline is a positive. Another positive as\n",
      "most of you know is that in the energy... the bailout whatever you call at\n",
      "that. The bailout, the $700 billion bailout legislation in Congress, as part\n",
      "of that as you know I think they did put in there that movement of ethanol or\n",
      "biodiesel would qualify for MLP treatments. So, means we don't have to count\n",
      "any revenues from ethanol or biodiesel handling against the 10% that we are\n",
      "allowed to have come from non-qualifying sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that's a plus for us and for all the MLPs. It means that if you can\n",
      "structure your lines in such a way that you could move large quantities of\n",
      "ethanol, you can debottleneck a lot of the rail transportation issues in this\n",
      "country. You'll laminate a lot of the unit trains. They are the primary movers\n",
      "of ethanol now. And that cash will automatically qualify for MLP treatment.\n",

      "Great. One last real quick question, on the increase in the cost between REX\n",

      "just looking at that project slate and identifying increase over, I think\n",
      "whether that starts with... touches a little over $7 billion numbers. That's\n",
      "22% instruments out, most of that, about 9% of that is in gas group. And a\n",
      "vast majority of that is related to construction cost increase. We try to\n",
      "break it down. And this is really kind of broken down to our share.\n",
      "Construction cost, we've spent on REX of about 200 of that, MEP is about 110\n",

      "\n",
      "**Richard D. Kinder - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh no. They are including everything. Our current estimate and again, when we\n",
      "say, we have about 2 billion left to spend, don't think that's $2 billion of\n",
      "Kinder Morgan money. That's $2 billion on aid age [ph] basis, we have\n",
      "financing at the joint venture level, that will take care of the debt\n",
      "component of that. And then the contribution from us Sempra and Conoco will be\n",
      "for what's left over on the equity side. So part of the $2 billion comes out\n",

      "the KMP and KMR units that we own it to KMR and Knight. That comes up pretty\n",
      "clear [ph]. We also have NGPL distributions that come out of our remaining 20%\n",
      "ownership of NGPL and that is the cash flow that we have. That is up to Knight\n",
      "to decide what it wants to do with that. And we have the opportunity to either\n",
      "distribute that up or we have the opportunity to pay down what debt is left at\n",
      "Knight, or we have the opportunity to reinvest it back in KMP or some place\n",
      "else. And so we have that in addition to the facility that is essentially\n",

      "It is really important that Knight is a very healthy company from a cash flow\n",

      "\n",
      "**Rajul Aggarwal - MarathonAsset Management**\n",
      "\n",
      "No, I understood. The reason I was asking the question was, from what you\n",
      "said, there isn't... in your view there was no need for the equity infusion\n",
      "right now in the near future that you saw. In the next three to six months if\n",
      "you get distributions and if you distribute amount to the equity holders of\n",
      "KMI, then that wouldn't be... I mean in that sense, the only capacity of debt\n",
      "would be the credit facility in some ways. That won't be cash sitting in\n",

      "last two, you've talked about the demand side of gas and how you're bullish on\n",
      "that. How does the supply side reaction to this drastic correction in gas\n",
      "prices impact your business if it has any impact... I mean does the outright\n",
      "gas price have an impact on your business?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Richard D. Kinder - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Well I think everything probably has some indirect impact if you're a major\n",
      "midstream player in the energy field but not a lot. The lower price of natural\n",
      "gas, if you want to look the glass half full, you would say it will lead to\n",
      "natural gas arguably recapturing some markets that otherwise would have lost.\n",
      "You may have more production, more industrial use of natural gas in the United\n",
      "States. I don't think those are big items one way or another but we have lower\n",
      "prices. You probably have a little more use.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the negative side, the glass half empty side you might say that some people\n",
      "in some places producers may scale back a little bit on their production. I\n",
      "think if they do that price will probably firm up again. But we don't think\n",
      "that the change in natural gas prices is going to have any significant impact\n",
      "on our business unless you had a fall to $2 or $3 and had producers cutting\n",
      "back dramatically, in which case, I think you've got to have a B type recovery\n",
      "in gas prices. So, I think that's kind of a non-event for us, the pricing of\n",
      "natural gas.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rajul Aggarwal - MarathonAsset Management**\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. And in terms of oil price in the CO2 segment?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Richard D. Kinder - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of oil prices, clearly, now as we said before, virtually all of our\n",
      "volumes at SACROC and Yates, the oil production there is hedged under long-\n",
      "term hedges. So we're not exposed to direct commodity price differentials up\n",
      "or down there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two areas in which we are exposed to indirectly or directly to oil prices\n",
      "are number one, most of our NGLs are not hedged. They are almost impossible to\n",
      "hedge a very dirty hedge when you start hedging NGLs as a lot of people have\n",
      "experienced. So we don't hedge those. So to the extent that the ratio of oil\n",
      "prices and naturally the delta between oil prices and natural gas prices, both\n",
      "of which have declined pretty dramatically as you know, to the extent that\n",
      "that delta changes and it has impact on our NGL volumes that we produce out in\n",
      "SACROC, about... we're averaging about 10,000 barrels, these are 8H numbers\n",
      "now, not our share... about 10,000 barrels a day of that, 15,000 barrels when\n",
      "we get the facility, when Exxon gets the facility at Beaumont back on line\n",
      "that will have some impact depending on how that spread turns out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we kind of benefit in that particular segment from lower natural gas\n",
      "prices, get hurt by lower liquids prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the final thing is that we set our prices on a number of our CO2\n",
      "sales contracts to third parties. A lot of those are set with a floor price,\n",
      "but upward escalation based on oil prices. Even though this is not a day-to-\n",
      "day thing because most of those are set a quarter in advance. So, for example,\n",
      "the set for the fourth quarter was the closing price on September 30th. The\n",
      "price for the third quarter was the closing price on June 30th. But we are\n",
      "exposed there in terms of the amount of our CO2, the value of some of our CO2\n",
      "sales contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "So those are the two negatives. On the other side, if oil prices come down in\n",

      "\n",
      "**C. Park Shaper - President**\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "**Unidentified Analyst**\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. And Park, when you guys talk about the debt number, given that the\n",
      "rating agencies are going to be looking at this, you're including the REX\n",
      "EBITDA in your earnings. If you could maybe give us what the debt numbers are\n",

      "Thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "**C. Park Shaper - President**\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "**C. Park Shaper - President**\n",

      "we're trying to give you when we talk about our distributable cash flow number\n",
      "is what we actually expect to receive out of REX in a distribution. And so\n",
      "that's why we add back the DD&A and we take off the sustaining CapEx.\n",

      "**Unidentified Analyst**\n",
      "\n",
      "Right, I understand that. Being on the debt side, we are just trying to look\n",

      "standpoint inclusive of REX. That's why I was asking for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "**C. Park Shaper - President**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I understand that they are looking at that, and we'll have some more\n",
      "conversations with S&P about that. I mean Rockies Express is an investment\n",
      "grade rated entity. It supports its own debt and we expect that it will going\n",
      "forward. The $1.3 billion on it is non-recourse to us. We expect that there\n",

      "Improving sales per community and the portion of our communities that are\n",
      "performing has been the foundation of our operational improvement efforts, it\n",

      "The results for the year very encouraging, on a trailing 12-month basis, we\n",
      "reached 2.3 sales per month per community, up nearly 30% from 1.8 sales per\n",
      "month a year ago. Equally improvement, looking at the average the last four\n",

      "81% from 69% a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned a moment ago, today we are introducing some longer term targets\n",

      "last four quarters to exceed 90%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second area where we have made great progress on our path to profitability\n",
      "is leveraging and in effect reducing our fixed costs. This includes both our\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Since we aren‚Äôt currently contemplating any transactions that would further\n",

      "\n",
      "In order to return to profitability we need to improve our gross margins and\n",

      "new way for us to discuss margins and it is very important.\n",

      "$37,000 we generated in fiscal 2012.\n",

      "17% over the $927 million reported in the third quarter of last year.\n",
      "Favorable currency translations versus last years third quarter increased this\n",
      "quarter's sales by about $40 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "The favorable impact of currency on reported sales for the quarter was\n",
      "approximately $10 million less, than we anticipated in July, when we provided\n",
      "guidance for the third quarter, based primarily on the strengthening of the\n",
      "U.S. dollar versus the Euro throughout the third quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal research and development tax credit expired at the end of 2007 and\n",
      "was extended for 2008 and 2009 earlier this month, retroactive to the\n",
      "beginning of the fiscal year. Because the extension of this legislation\n",
      "occurred during our fiscal fourth quarter, GAAP requires us to estimate and\n",
      "record our effective income tax rate through the third quarter, assuming that\n",
      "the research and development credit was not extended and to recognize the\n",
      "retroactive benefit of this legislation during our fiscal fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net\n",
      "earnings however, we are presenting our results as if the tax credit was\n",
      "extended for 2008, as of the beginning of the fiscal year. As a result,\n",
      "comments referencing our third quarter results and our guidance for 2008,\n",
      "including earnings per share amounts are presented, based on this assumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earnings per share were $0.57 for the third quarter of 2008, a 24% increase\n",

      "third quarter 2008 sales results by product category with guidance for the\n",
      "fourth quarter of 2008, let me comment on the currency exchange rates we are\n",
      "currently using in our outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro\n",
      "and the yen. On our conference call one quarter ago, we assumed that for the\n",
      "second half of 2008, each euro would translate into about $1.54 to $1.58 and\n",
      "that each 105 yen to 110 yen would translate into $1.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now assume that for the fourth quarter of 2008, each euro will translate\n",
      "into about $1.33 to $1.38 and that each 100 yen to 105 yen will translate into\n",
      "$1. This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates has the impact\n",
      "of reducing total forecasted sales for the fourth quarter by about $30\n",
      "million, $20 million of which relates to our Cardiac Rhythm Management product\n",
      "sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, as we mentioned in our last earnings call, our fourth quarter\n",
      "this year will have 64 selling days, versus 61 selling days in the fourth\n",
      "quarter of 2007 due to our 52, 53 week fiscal year convention. Given that the\n",
      "Christmas and New Year's holidays both fall on a Thursday this year, we expect\n",
      "the two of these three additional selling days to have little impact on sales\n",
      "for the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the discussion of sales by product category: For the third quarter,\n",
      "total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, which include revenue from both our ICD\n",

      "For the fourth quarter of 2008, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the\n",
      "range of $680 million to $710 million. As I mentioned, our current exchange\n",

      "contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated inner company\n",
      "positions and third party trade receivables. The contracts will be mark-to-\n",
      "market and any resulting gains or losses are expected to be generally offset\n",

      "\n",
      "Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook\n",
      "for the fourth quarter and the full year 2008. In preparing our EPS guidance,\n",
      "we have assumed that in the fourth quarter of 2008 and for the full year of\n",
      "2008 the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about\n",
      "349 million to 351 million shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2008, excludes the catch\n",
      "up portion of the benefit that we will record for GAAP purposes, related to\n",
      "the extension of the federal research and development credit that is\n",
      "retroactive to the beginning of 2008. The company's expects consolidated EPS\n",
      "for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.61, and for the full\n",
      "year of 2008, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.30 to\n",
      "$2.32.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in previous years, we will give guidance for 2009 during our fourth quarter\n",
      "call in January. With that in mind, let me offer just a few preliminary\n",
      "comments regarding our 2009 outlook. We are right now in the process of\n",
      "developing our operating plan and budgets for 2009, and the visibility into a\n",
      "number of variables that will influence our 2009 results will become clear as\n",
      "we move closer to the start of next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of these variables is the impact of foreign currency on our operations.\n",
      "Another factor is the positive impact from our ongoing productivity\n",
      "initiatives, which have the affect of reducing operating expense as a\n",
      "percentage of net sales. Taking all of this into account, we are optimistic\n",
      "that when we complete our 2009 operating plan, we will be comfortable that we\n",
      "will be planning to meet or exceed current consensus expectations of $2.61 for\n",
      "earning per share in 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will update everyone on our official guidance for 2009 in January, when we\n",
      "report our fourth quarter results. I would now like to turn it back to Dan\n",
      "Starks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Daniel J. Starks - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, John. Our year-to-date 17% growth in revenue and 31% growth in\n",
      "earnings per share reinforces our confidence that St. Jude Medical is in the\n",
      "right markets with the right products at the right time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to spend the next few minutes reviewing the reasons for this\n",
      "confidence, starting with discussion of the Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM\n",
      "market. Despite its many challenges, the CRM market continues to provide an\n",
      "unusually strong growth opportunity for St. Jude Medical. It sometimes is\n",
      "overlooked, that the CRM market itself has grown almost $1 billion in the last\n",
      "four quarters and will total approximately $11 billion this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect the global CRM market to continue to grow at mid to high single\n",
      "digit rate. Keep in mind that we have only two major competitors in this $11\n",
      "billion space and the 2008 will be the fifth year in a row in which we have\n",
      "gained total CRM market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect to continue to gain share in the CRM market in 2009 and beyond for\n",
      "all of the reasons we have indicated previously. These reasons are important\n",
      "enough that I would like reiterate several of them briefly. First, as result\n",
      "of our leadership continuity, our sustained execution of a consistent\n",
      "strategic plan over the last 10 years and our consistent expansion of\n",
      "investment in R&D, our product line is stronger and more competitive than it\n",
      "has ever been relative to the competition. We have been averaging over 20 new\n",
      "CRM products per year. We have the only seven French high-voltage leads on the\n",
      "market.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have the only full featured local language programmers on the market in\n",
      "Japan and in China. We have the only technology available to optimize B to B\n",
      "and A to B timing in an ICD within minutes during an office follow-up visit\n",
      "without the need for a separate echocardiography procedure. During the fourth\n",
      "quarter, we are just starting to roll out our Merlin@home wireless remote\n",
      "patient care system in United States and in Europe. This technology puts us in\n",
      "the wireless remote follow up space for the first time and is a particularly\n",
      "important addition to our product line when combined with capabilities of our\n",
      "electronic medical records program and with upcoming devices such as our Atlas\n",
      "[ph] ICD.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are beginning a limited launch during the fourth quarter in Europe of our\n",
      "Atlas [ph] ICD product line which includes one of the most meaningful new\n",
      "technologies any company has brought to the ICD market in some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Eric Fain mentioned, at our Annual Investors conference earlier this year,\n",
      "the Atlas [ph] ICD contains a patented algorithm that initially will be used\n",
      "to trend myocardium ischemia events by detecting ST segment shifts. This\n",
      "technology ultimately has the potential to predict an imminent myocardium\n",
      "infarction and notify the patient to get to an emergency room for intervention\n",
      "before the onset of symptoms or cardiac damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are fully focused on leveraging our Merlin Wireless Remote Patient Care\n",
      "System, our 7 French high-voltage leads and our patented ischemia detection\n",
      "technology, not only to gain CRM market share but also to increase both the\n",
      "cost effectiveness of an ICD propellers and the value of an ICD for referring\n",
      "physicians and for patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "The product line advantages, I have mentioned briefly are only the tip of the\n",
      "iceberg. I appreciate that every company talks about how good its products are\n",
      "but the proof is in market share changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "St. Jude Medical is the only CRM Company that has gained CRM market share\n",
      "every year the last five years in a row. We expect to be in an even stronger\n",
      "position with respect to our product line compared with our competitors moving\n",
      "forward than we have been doing the last five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, moving past product based reasons for our optimism that we are well\n",
      "positioned to continue gaining CRM market share, I would like to move on to\n",
      "the topic of our people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, St. Jude Medical has gained CRM market share, even though we've\n",
      "had a disadvantage with respect to field coverage. Using the U.S market as an\n",
      "example, we previously have talked about our addition of approximately 450\n",
      "field sales and support people over a four quarter period, at the same time\n",
      "that the competition conducted layoffs and suffered significant involuntary\n",
      "loss of experienced talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar dynamics with respect to people played out in other geographies as\n",
      "well. What once was a disadvantage for St. Jude Medical with respect to people\n",
      "and coverage has turned into an advantage. Again, I appreciate that every\n",
      "company has [ph] some advantage with respect to service and coverage, and that\n",
      "it can be difficult to sort through competing claims. The proof is in trends\n",
      "relating to customer contract, numbers of centers implanting each company's\n",
      "devices and ultimately market share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although we do not disclose full details about the first two metrics for\n",
      "competitive reasons, we have provided enough visibility about these metrics to\n",
      "help everyone understand the many reasons that we have gained CRM market share\n",
      "every year the last five years in a row, and the basis for our confidence that\n",
      "we will continue to gain CRM market share going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our third category of reasons, for our optimism that we will continue to gain\n",
      "CRM market share, in addition to the strength of our products and of our\n",
      "people is the impact of our additional programs. For example, we have strong\n",
      "customer and product line synergy between our Atrial Fibrillation or AF\n",
      "program, and our CRM business. We are leaders in developing additional heart\n",
      "failure diagnostics, such as our six vector impedance based pulmonary edema\n",
      "diagnostic technology and our direct left atrial pressure sensing technology\n",
      "to go along with the potentially break through ischemia detection technology\n",
      "we already have discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this is surrounded by our commitment to connect patient data and our\n",
      "devices directly to every major electronic medical record system. There is\n",
      "plenty more to say about the value of our competitive position in the CRM\n",
      "market, but I would like to move on to talk about Atrial Fibrillation or AF.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AF market is the second major example where St. Jude Medical is in the\n",
      "right market with the right products at the right time. This market already is\n",
      "a $1.5 billion market even though it is less than 10% penetrated. The broad AF\n",
      "market is continuing to grow at a strong double digit rate and is on track to\n",

      "the bottom line, it's... you think that we manufacture products in Swedish\n",

      "dollars, we manufacture in U.S. dollars.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thanks John and good morning. Today we're pleased to report third quarter\n",
      "results that beat expectations with high-teens sales and earnings growth.\n",
      "Diluted earnings per share of $0.79 were above our previous guidance range of\n",
      "$0.76 to $0.78, reflecting EPS growth of nearly 18% over the prior year. We\n",
      "are also pleased to be raising our EPS outlook for the full year 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sales for the quarter were $7.5 billion, an increase of more than 17%, also\n",
      "ahead of our previous forecast. As a result of our performance to date and our\n",
      "outlook for the remainder of the year, today, we are again raising our full\n",
      "year ongoing earnings per share guidance range to $3.31 to $3.33, up from the\n",
      "previous range of $3.24 to $3.28. The midpoint of this new guidance range\n",
      "reflects nearly 17% growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this performance, we're clearly seeing the results of our efforts as we\n",
      "build Abbott into a global, diversified healthcare company with recognized\n",
      "market leadership positions and top tier financial performance. We've\n",
      "differentiated ourselves from our peers with multiple core growth franchises,\n",
      "significant cash flow and a diversified base of earnings. We're well\n",
      "positioned to continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth while investing\n",
      "to sustain growth into 2009 and beyond. We believe we provide a unique blend\n",
      "of both safety and growth in this difficult market environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Board of Directors recently authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase\n",
      "program. Last year, we returned more than $3 billion to shareholders through\n",
      "share repurchases and dividends and we're on track to exceed that level in\n",
      "2008. We expect record operating cash flow for the full year 2008 and we\n",
      "increased our dividend by nearly 11% earlier this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the specifics of our quarterly results. Our sales growth of 17.6%\n",
      "this quarter included a favorable 4.7% effective exchange rate. Results were\n",
      "strong across each of our global businesses with pharmaceuticals, diagnostics,\n",
      "vascular and nutritional all contributing double-digit sales growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also see good performance from our key growth drivers. This includes\n",
      "XIENCE, which is off to a very strong start in the first quarter of its U.S.\n",
      "launch; HUMIRA, which was up 50% worldwide; double-digit growth in our lipid\n",
      "franchise and more than 22% growth in international nutrition. John will\n",
      "discuss these in more detail in his review of the business operating\n",
      "highlights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The adjusted gross margin ratio in the quarter was 57.5%, at the high-end of\n",
      "our guidance range. Total R&D and SG&A as adjusted increased more than 13%,\n",
      "reflecting investment spending across the businesses in part to support the\n",
      "launches of new products and indications as well as continued investment in\n",
      "our broad-based pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tax rate this quarter was 21%, in line with our previous forecast. As a\n",
      "reminder, the U.S. R&D tax credit was not enacted until October so it had no\n",
      "impact on our third quarter rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's turn to the outlook for the remainder of 2008. As I mentioned, today\n",
      "we're raising our 2008 earnings per share guidance to $3.31 to $3.33, the\n",
      "midpoint of which would be growth of almost 17%. In fact, our EPS guidance was\n",
      "up approximately $0.10 per share from our original guidance provided in\n",
      "January. Sales growth for the full year is expected to be in the mid teens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me walk you through some of the key P&L line items as we forecast them\n",
      "for the fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect sales growth in the low double-digits including an estimated 2%\n",
      "negative impact from exchange, a gross margin ratio of around 59%, continued\n",
      "strong investment in the business with SG&A and R&D both up low double digits\n",
      "and other income of approximately $125 million, reflecting ongoing payments\n",
      "from Takeda following the conclusion of the TAP joint venture. The fourth\n",
      "quarter tax rate is expected to be between 18.5% and 19%, which reflects our\n",
      "current 21% rate less the full year impact of the R&D tax credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in summary, our global, diversified business strategy is delivering strong\n",
      "results. It's based on competing in high growth markets where product\n",
      "differentiation drives market success. The products within our core\n",
      "franchises, HUMIRA, XIENCE, international nutritional, our lipids portfolio\n",
      "and the compounds in our pipeline are all examples of the success of our\n",
      "strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are very pleased with our third quarter performance. We reported strong\n",
      "sales growth, more than 17%... of more than 17%, EPS that beat our original\n",
      "guidance and we raised our earnings per share guidance range for the full\n",
      "year. And we expect this strength to continue into 2009 as we continue to\n",
      "target another year of double-digit EPS growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, let's turn to the business operating highlights. John?\n",
      "\n",
      "**John B. Thomas - Vice President, Investor Relations**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks Tom. This morning I'll review the quarterly performance of our major\n",
      "business segments: pharmaceuticals, nutritionals and medical products\n",
      "including Abbott Vascular, Diagnostics and Diabetes Care.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let me start with our medical products businesses where sales in the\n",
      "quarter increased more than 25%.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our Vascular business, global sales were $636 million in the quarter, an\n",
      "increase of 58%. We saw especially strong growth in our worldwide coronary\n",
      "stent business, which had sales of $383 million. In the U.S., coronary stent\n",
      "sales were driven by rapid uptake of our drug-eluting stent XIENCE V, which,\n",
      "as you know, we launched in the U.S. in July.\n",
      "\n",
      "The launch, while still early, has led to steady market share gains as XIENCE\n",
      "continues to gain share at the expense of all of the three major competitors.\n",
      "XIENCE is clearly the product of choice among interventional cardiologists\n",
      "based on its unprecedented clinical data, which continues to get better and\n",
      "best-in-class deliverability, confirming that physicians are viewing XIENCE as\n",
      "a truly next-generation drug-eluting stent.\n",
      "\n",
      "This week at the TCT Interventional Cardiology meeting, we presented two year\n",
      "results from the meta-analysis of our XIENCE clinical trials, SPIRIT II and\n",
      "SPIRIT III. This data confirms that XIENCE V continues to deliver clinically\n",
      "significant outcomes for patients compared to TAXUS, outperforming TAXUS in\n",
      "key efficacy and safety endpoints out to two years. The differences between\n",
      "XIENCE and TAXUS grew between one and two years, reinforcing the long-term\n",
      "safety and efficacy profile of XIENCE. This includes a 45% reduction in major\n",
      "adverse cardiac events or MACE; a 41% reduction in heart attack or death and a\n",
      "41% reduction in revascularization. This strong clinical data is being well\n",
      "accepted in the market. In just three months, XIENCE has become the number one\n",
      "stent on the U.S. market with share in the mid to upper 20s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XIENCE platform which includes PROMUS has become the most popular stent\n",
      "platform in the U.S. with more than 50% market share. PROMUS is the private\n",
      "label version of XIENCE distributed by Boston Scientific. And as a reminder,\n",
      "we benefit economically from Boston Scientific's sales of PROMUS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the DES market broadly, we're very pleased to see continued, steady\n",
      "improvement. U.S. DES penetration has now surpassed 70% in the U.S. PCI\n",
      "[percutaneous coronary intervention] volumes have also improved, up in the mid\n",
      "single digits versus the third quarter of last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of the U.S., we also continue to make steady progress with XIENCE. In\n",
      "Western Europe, XIENCE share alone has surpassed CYPHER, ENDEAVOR and now\n",
      "TAXUS to claim the number one market leadership position. In total, XIENCE V\n",
      "is now the leading drug-eluting stent across all geographies in which it's\n",
      "been launched. We filed for Japanese market approval earlier this year and\n",
      "look forward to expansion into this market with a launch towards the end of\n",
      "next year, 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of the successful U.S. launch, the continued shared gains outside\n",
      "of the U.S. and the recent improvements in the overall DES market, our DES\n",
      "franchise revenues this quarter outperformed our expectations with $305\n",
      "million in combined sales. As a reminder, DES franchise sales include global\n",
      "XIENCE sales as well as other third party DES product revenues. This includes\n",
      "the royalty revenue we received from Medtronic on ENDEAVOR as well as revenue\n",
      "we received from Boston Scientific of course on sales of PROMUS.\n",
      "\n",
      "So as we look ahead to the forth quarter, we expect global vascular sales to\n",
      "continue to grow strong double digits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me turn to our worldwide Diagnostics business where sales grew more\n",
      "than 15% this quarter, representing strong revenue growth in all three\n",
      "Diagnostic segments: core diagnostics, molecular diagnostics and point of care\n",
      "diagnostics.\n",
      "\n",
      "We saw double-digit growth both in the U.S. and internationally in our core\n",
      "diagnostics segment again this quarter. This was the result of continued\n",
      "strong growth of both our PRISM blood analyzer as well as our ARCHITECT\n",
      "immunochemistry system. We've launched new ARCHITECT systems including the\n",
      "i1000 for smaller labs and the c16000 for large labs. In the third quarter,\n",
      "Abbot submitted for U.S. FDA approval of our ARCHITECT core hepatitis test.\n",
      "Approval of the core test would complete our hepatitis B panel of tests in the\n",
      "U.S. and represent an important milestone in the expansion of ARCHITECT's\n",
      "automated hepatitis testing menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abbot submitted for FDA approval its PRISM HIVO Plus assay, a fully automated\n",
      "blood screening test designed to detect HIV-1, HIV-2 and HIV Group O and serum\n",
      "and plasma. This assay will further enhance the panel of screening tests in\n",
      "our highly successful Abbott PRISM blood screening instrument for the U.S.\n",
      "market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also in the quarter, we announced plans to improve profitability in our core\n",
      "diagnostics business. These actions support our efforts to reduce overall\n",
      "costs, improve efficiencies and expand margins. We've seen improved margins\n",
      "already this year and expect that improvement to continue as we anticipate\n",
      "doubling profit and cash flow in this particular business over the next\n",
      "several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our point of care business, sales grew more than 15% in the third quarter.\n",
      "Growth was driven by strong sales across all segments as well as successful\n",
      "execution in both large U.S. hospitals and alternate site locations. Abbott's\n",
      "i-STAT analyzer is now used in one out of every three U.S. hospitals and in\n",
      "more than 500 emergency rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in molecular diagnostics, sales this quarter increased more than 35%,\n",
      "driven by strong growth of both the m2000 and our Vysis products. In the U.S.,\n",
      "we've submitted for FDA approval of our hepatitis B assay for the m2000. And\n",
      "outside of the U.S., we've received CE mark for the HPV assay on the m2000,\n",
      "which we planned to launch in Europe next month.\n",
      "\n",
      "So looking ahead to the fourth quarter in our worldwide Diagnostics\n",
      "businesses, we anticipate mid single-digit growth, which includes the impact\n",
      "of foreign exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Diabetes Care, sales in the quarter increased more than 10% globally,\n",
      "driven by strong international sales and increasing adoption of our new no-\n",
      "calibration meters, FreeStyle Lite and FreeStyle Freedom Lite which eliminate\n",
      "the manual calibration step required by most glucose meters, improving\n",
      "convenience for those people living with diabetes. In the quarter, we saw\n",
      "positive share results from the promotional program we initiated last quarter\n",
      "and continued prescription share gains of our FreeStyle meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the U.S., sales growth this quarter were impacted by the comparison to the\n",
      "prior year and FreeStyle Lite launched. Adjusted for initial shipments for\n",
      "last year's launch, growth this quarter in the U.S. approached about 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of the U.S., we continue to see strong growth internationally. In\n",
      "emerging markets, Abbott is the number two player and our sales are growing\n",
      "more than 20%. In the fourth quarter, we expect high single digit growth\n",
      "worldwide in Abbott Diabetes Care, which also includes the impact of foreign\n",
      "exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our global nutritionals business, sales this quarter were up more than 14%,\n",
      "driven by more than 22% growth in international nutritionals. We continue to\n",
      "see double-digit growth across both pediatric and adult nutritional products\n",
      "internationally, particularly in emerging markets such as Latin America and\n",
      "Asia where population growth and improving economies are leading to increased\n",
      "demand for our high quality nutritional products.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the U.S., we recently launched Similac Advance EarlyShield, a new and\n",
      "improved formulation in a new and redesigned package. Developed to be more\n",
      "like breast milk, it's the first and only infant formula with a unique blend\n",
      "of prebiotics, nucleotides and antioxidants to improve a baby's immune system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fourth quarter, in our nutritionals business, we expect mid to high\n",
      "single-digit growth in the U.S. and continued double-digit growth, strong\n",
      "double-digit growth internationally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning now to our global pharmaceuticals business where sales in the third\n",
      "quarter increased nearly 17%, driven by more than 21% growth in international\n",
      "pharmaceuticals and nearly 13% growth in our U.S. business. Several key\n",
      "products drove performance this quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let me start with immunology where worldwide HUMIRA sales this quarter were\n",
      "up 50% to $1.2 billion including 67% international growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're obviously very pleased with the results of our launch in the psoriasis\n",
      "market where we've exceeded expectations on a number of launch metrics. In\n",
      "less than eight months since our FDA approval for this indication, HUMIRA\n",
      "total prescription share has gained approximately 15 share points and is now\n",
      "approaching 30% total share. New prescription share now exceeds 30%. HUMIRA is\n",
      "now capturing nearly as many self injectable new to brand psoriasis patients\n",
      "as the market leader. And more than 4200 dermatologists have now written\n",
      "prescriptions for HUMIRA. Our early success in this market is based on\n",

      "\n",
      "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question this morning is from Larry Keusch,\n",
      "and please state your company name.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lawrence Keusch - Goldman Sachs**\n",
      "\n",
      "It's Goldman Sachs. Good morning guys.\n",
      "\n",

      "Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lawrence Keusch - Goldman Sachs**\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey Tom, as you made your comments and gave us some read through to your\n",
      "expectations for 2009, which is for double-digit earnings growth, could you\n",
      "just walk us through sort of what parts of the Abbott business you believe\n",
      "could be sensitive to a global slowing in GDP and what steps you might have\n",
      "available to you to offset any growth there to continue to ensure that you can\n",
      "get that double-digit growth?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thomas C. Freyman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial\n",
      "Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Larry, sure. When I talk about double-digit growth, it's really driven by\n",
      "the momentum we're seeing in all of these businesses. I mean if you go through\n",
      "the quarter, we're performing really across the board very well in all of our\n",
      "businesses. And that gives me a lot of confidence in our ability to continue\n",
      "to grow the earnings of this company in line with the investment identity we\n",
      "have and really the targets we've repeatedly stated. So fundamentals there are\n",
      "really just what's going on in the businesses and how well we're executing and\n",
      "really the portfolio of products we have to be able to deliver that kind of\n",
      "growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think Abbott... we have not seen anything to date on counting the economy\n",
      "and an impact on our business. In pharma, we're very specialty focused, and\n",
      "those are long-term chronic disease areas that are very immune to economic\n",
      "activity and we have very little exposure, as you know, to things like\n",
      "discretionary consumer products. So we haven't seen much and I think our\n",
      "business is going to be quite different than most because of the types of\n",
      "areas we do business in.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lawrence Keusch - Goldman Sachs**\n",
      "\n",
      "And Tom, just one of the growth drivers, that's been very nice and strong for\n",
      "you guys has been that international nutritional business. Again, how much\n",
      "exposure there is due to consumer if you look at some of those zone bars and\n",
      "other things that people might stop... not stop buying? I suspect it's pretty\n",
      "small overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thomas C. Freyman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial\n",
      "Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "It's pretty much the same as what I said on the other businesses. First of\n",
      "all, I think any concern of economic slowdown is a little more U.S.-focused as\n",
      "I recall all the various economists and the like. International growth in\n",
      "these markets has continued to be very, very strong. And that one product you\n",
      "mentioned is a very, very minor product for us in the international market. So\n",
      "anyway, really, what's driving that is the base product, the pediatric\n",
      "nutritional, the adult nutritionals that people really see as more core to\n",
      "their essential as opposed to discretionary type items. So I think in that\n",
      "business as well and as we've forecasted '09 as we go through our reviews\n",
      "here, we continue to feel very good about the ability of these markets to grow\n",
      "and our products to continue to gain share and the fact these products are\n",
      "pretty resilient.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lawrence Keusch - Goldman Sachs**\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. And then one other question, which is as look at your cash balances,\n",
      "obviously lots of challenges out there in the credit markets. Could you just,\n",
      "for the benefit of all of us, just give us a sense of what that cash balance\n",
      "really is sitting in and perhaps any exposures to any securities within some\n",
      "of the subprime mortgages? And I guess along with that question is sort of how\n",
      "has your commercial paper funding been going? Are you getting access to that?\n",
      "And then John, just a quick clarification, the forth quarter sales guidance\n",
      "that you gave for growth, it sounded like that already included the impact of\n",
      "currency, but I just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly.\n",

      "Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "On the credit market situation, as you know, we are very conservatively\n",
      "managed from a financial perspective. The deposits we have and the cash we\n",
      "have invested are in very, very high quality instruments. And we've even\n",
      "obviously become even more cautious in the last few months in terms of\n",
      "selecting where we put our money. We have absolutely no exposure to any of the\n",
      "types of exotic instruments that you talked about, and there is absolutely no\n",
      "issue there. And as a very strong credit [ph], we have been really unaffected\n",
      "by the turmoil in the credit markets. We've had no problems whatsoever issuing\n",
      "commercial paper at very attractive rates. And I think we are the type of\n",
      "credit, the way I read into this is we are the type of credit people are\n",
      "looking for in this type of market. And we've got a $4 billion essentially\n",
      "unused backup credit line. We have no plans and have not drawn anything on\n",
      "that because we have great access to the commercial paper market. So we are in\n",
      "great position from a credit perspective and have been really unaffected by\n",
      "the turmoil in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lawrence Keusch - Goldman Sachs**\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "**John B. Thomas - Vice President, Investor Relations**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Larry, just to clarify, this is John. Yes, all the numbers and forecast\n",
      "that I gave for the fourth quarter include the impact of exchange, which, at\n",
      "this point, top of the house, corporate, we expect to be unfavorable, about\n",
      "2%. So when we look at the total company and growth into the fourth quarter,\n",
      "we expect sales growth of low double-digits, that accounts for a roughly 2%\n",
      "unfavorable impact from exchange.\n",

      "**Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, it's JPMorgan. A few questions. Just wanted to clarify on the\n",
      "pipeline. First, you seem relatively confident in the near-term approvals for\n",
      "Vicodin CR and TRILIPIX. Can you comment on when you think you'll have this\n",
      "submission into a combination of TRILIPIX plus CRESTOR?\n",

      "**Thomas C. Freyman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial\n",
      "Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we talked about that being a later, next year, second half '09.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan**\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. And that's... so the assumption is still a back half of '09 event?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thomas C. Freyman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial\n",
      "Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Correct. Yes. And if that changes, I'll let you know. Obviously, we like to be\n",
      "conservative when we give our forecast. So we'll see. We're moving along\n",
      "nicely.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me push you just for a minute on... make sure I understand some the\n",
      "numbers you ran off, Tom, on the fourth quarter and full year updated\n",
      "guidance. You mentioned $125 million of other income. Was that... that was for\n",
      "the fourth quarter, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thomas C. Freyman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial\n",
      "Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "That's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan**\n",
      "\n",
      "And what is that attributable to? Where does that comes from?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thomas C. Freyman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial\n",
      "Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "That is all the payments from Takeda associated with the TAP wind down. As\n",
      "we've said at the beginning of the year, we went from a joint venture income\n",
      "situation and income in the... I don't know... north of $350 million to this\n",
      "approach where we're taking payments from Takeda associated with Prevacid and\n",
      "pipeline products. And that number in the fourth quarter would bring us pretty\n",
      "close to the full year number we've been taking about all along. We are\n",
      "actually a little bit higher because the performance has been a little better\n",
      "than we conservatively forecasted. So that's entirely due to the TAP activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan**\n",
      "\n",
      "Got you. And then, so if I think about you're changing your guidance, you're\n",
      "raising your guidance here for the full year, it would look to me like you're\n",
      "still being on the conservative end. The R&D tax credit, so if we start with\n",
      "$3.24 to $3.28, which is where you were, the R&D tax credit would seem to add\n",
      "$0.03, the other income would appear to add $0.04. So even without the beat\n",
      "from this quarter, you would seem to already be at or even pushing above the\n",
      "high-end of your old guidance and so what's [ph] the beat from this quarter?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thomas C. Freyman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial\n",
      "Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me clarify a couple of things there, Mike. R&D tax credit $0.02 to $0.03,\n",
      "something like that. We'll see exactly what the number comes in when we close\n",
      "out the year. The TAP... the other income has always been part of our\n",
      "forecast. That's not really an add to our previous guidance. That's consistent\n",
      "with our previous guidance. So it's pretty much seeing the momentum in the\n",
      "business from the third quarter, flowing that through. The R&D tax credit is\n",
      "helping in the fourth quarter. But overall, it's a better, certainly a better\n",
      "fourth quarter forecast than we provided back in the second quarter even\n",
      "adjusted for the R&D tax credits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan**\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. So you had that 125 of other income. We did not, but you did.\n",

      "**Thomas C. Freyman - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial\n",
      "Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely, not [indiscernible]. Yes, at the beginning, we've provided that\n",
      "full year number and, as I... as we've said all along, it's a little bumpier\n",
      "than the income from the TAP joint venture. We've been forecasting the\n",
      "quarterly amount somewhat conservatively. But if you add up all the quarters\n",
      "on that, it's very consistent with our guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan**\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, last question. On the share authorization which you announced I think on\n",

      "While the fiscal year proves to be another great year of performance, but also\n",
      "the year of great transformation as we made a number of vital changes to\n",

      "These initiatives among others helped us increase our sales by 20.2% year-on-\n",
      "year or more than twice the industry growth rate, to a record of $183.8\n",
      "million in fiscal ‚Äô08. In the last five years, our compound annual growth rate\n",

      "myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few however are realizing that we have increased EBITDA faster in sales in\n",
      "four of the last five years. In fact we increased our EBITDA margin from\n",
      "negative 1.1% in fiscal 2004 to 14.8% in 2007, despite a very strong headwind\n",
      "from the Canadian dollar, which appreciated by about 30% during the timeframe.\n",
      "Know that our 2007 EBITDA margin would have been at 12% if you exclude the\n",
      "one-time gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fiscal ‚Äô08, our EBITDA margin reduced slightly to 11.2% because we accepted\n",
      "some short-term impact against more important long-term benefits with the\n",
      "acquisition of Brix Networks and the opening of our new manufacturing center\n",
      "in China. Now that we are at that level we believe that we have still room and\n",
      "capacity to expand our EBITDA margin further in the longer-term, we think it‚Äôs\n",
      "doable to reach eventually 16%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back to 2008, although the Brix acquisition was negative to earning for the\n",

      "earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, our manufacturing facility in China was slightly negative\n",
      "to earnings in fiscal ‚Äô08, but should really be accretive in 2009 and beyond\n",
      "and will enable us to become more competitive in the marketplace and globally\n",
      "and extend further market share gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now talking of the acquisition of Navtel and Brixs; looking at these two\n",
      "acquisitions that occurred in fiscal 2008, we purchased both Navtel\n",
      "Communications and Brix Networks based on their excellent fit with our long-\n",

      "a leader into next-generation converged IP networks and get us higher up into\n",
      "the protocol track where a better margin can be generated.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Brix Networks on the other hand is a technology leader in converged voice-over\n",

      "are helping Brix to secure larger and more frequent deals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going forward, Navtel and Brix represent the blueprint to our acquisition\n",
      "strategy. Our strategy is very simply based on first and foremost strong\n",
      "organic growth, supported by acquisition of the small to mid-sized companies\n",
      "that are providing us with best-of-class technologies in nascent and high\n",
      "growth markets. Consequently, we do occasionally acquiring slightly\n",
      "unprofitable companies at the beginning of their sales growth curve, but in\n",
      "that case that must be exponential in the near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let‚Äôs talk now of fiscal 2008 and provide some highlights. Clearly, we\n",
      "initiated a number of changes in ‚Äò08 with a long-term horizon, but progress\n",
      "was made in several fronts that are worthy of **** mention. I‚Äôm especially\n",
      "proud of our Telecom Division, which increased sales 24% year-on-year led by\n",
      "97.4% growth in our protocol activity, that includes partial revenue\n",
      "contribution from Navtel and Brix in ‚Äò08.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the last three years, our protocol test business has grown by a CAGR of\n",
      "74.4% or if your strictly looking at organic growth, that‚Äôs grown for three\n",
      "years at a CAGR of 64.5%, which is quite amazing. In fiscal ‚Äô09, we expect\n",
      "this segment to represent about one-third of our Telecom business and we\n",
      "expect that that segment long-term to both contribute not only to revenue\n",
      "growth, but substantial as well into earning growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not coincidentally, our gross margin also improved for six consecutive years\n",
      "to reach 58.9% in fiscal ‚Äô08 and I‚Äôm really optimistic that it will continue\n",
      "its upward trajectory in the upcoming years to reach 62% and eventually\n",
      "beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at our optical test business, sales increased 12.7% year-on-year,\n",
      "which is less than our typical 18% to 20% growth for this segment. The drop in\n",
      "spending **** at our largest customer Verizon, which went from $22.5 million\n",
      "in fiscal ‚Äô07 to $13.6 million in fiscal ‚Äô08 is largely responsible for the\n",
      "reduced growth rate in optical testing as the optical revenue reduced between\n",
      "‚Äô07 to ‚Äô08 in optics, it has grown in other segments of our business, so\n",
      "reducing it further, the optical contribution at Verizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we are not losing ground at this account for our optical business and we‚Äôre\n",
      "remaining very well entrenched for the home deployment, but we are getting\n",
      "market share and this accounts for other areas such as transport and datacom\n",
      "testing. So our protocol business is making progress with that account.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of our copper access test business in fiscal ‚Äô08, sales were down\n",
      "3.9% year-on-year, but I‚Äôm really pleased that revenues are now increasingly\n",
      "derived from our new access to 100 SharpTESTER platform and all the related\n",
      "modules that we sell along with it; as well as we have diversified very, very\n",
      "much more, our customer base for this business units with a number of new\n",
      "customer wins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed we‚Äôre now engaging Tier-1 on larger and cutting edge opportunities,\n",
      "which resemble the same path for growth that our successful protocol test\n",
      "business had been following. When we acquire the business from Consultronics\n",
      "we more-or-less had the vast majority of our business made with only three\n",
      "accounts and this is not the case anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs talk about long-term visions, strategy and some of our metrics going\n",
      "forward. I‚Äôd like to say at this point and I would like to share with you some\n",
      "highlights of our three year strategic plan, so that you‚Äôve got a better idea\n",
      "of where we‚Äôre headed and what we‚Äôre trying to accomplish. I believe that this\n",
      "new information will help our shareholders to better understand our long-term\n",
      "directions that EXFO‚Äôs management is taking towards value creation and how we\n",
      "plan to grow revenues and earnings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our vision is to become the market leader in global and telecom test and\n",
      "service assurance industry. Especially, in the testing of next-gen converged\n",
      "IP networks, by offering innovative solutions in high growth segments that\n",
      "extend across the life cycle with a strong focus on network operators. From\n",
      "the network infrastructure standpoint, we will increasingly climb the protocol\n",
      "stack, the triple-play service and next-generation converged IP networking\n",
      "through advanced test and assurance solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect network service providers will remain our primary end-market, while\n",
      "targeting high growth niches along network equipment manufactures. We do not\n",
      "intent to become a one stop-shop for our customers, but rather continue to be\n",
      "a strong player in selected high growth markets. We will follow this roadmap\n",
      "by offering best-in-class solutions, both in terms of quality, functionality\n",
      "and ease-of-use, while providing the highest level of customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve our long term vision, we plan to expand our leadership position in\n",
      "the protocol optical test segment, while growing our protocol test business\n",
      "even faster to eventually surpass optical in terms of sale. This plan is\n",
      "largely predicated on organic growth while mainly through market share gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will also seek early in the gain leading hedge companies in high growth\n",
      "markets to accelerate our growth and we‚Äôll also be looking at partnerships and\n",
      "alliances going forward to also maximize value for our shareholders, but in\n",
      "our high value benchmarking performance, we have established three copper\n",
      "performance objectives to build the success of our three year plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we plan to increase our sales by an excess of two time the industry\n",
      "growth rate and maintain 20% CAGR during the next three year period. We want\n",
      "to grow EBITDA even faster than sales during that period of time, so we plan\n",
      "to have EBITDA being above 20% growth basically as an average of the next\n",
      "three years and we also plan to raise gross margin to a sustainable level\n",
      "above 60%, targeting 62% within a three year timeframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "These objectives will guide our actions in the next few years and we are\n",
      "committed to maximize shareholder value. Hopefully, this new information will\n",
      "draw attention to EXFO‚Äôs long-term potential and offer investors a more\n",
      "complete picture of our investment proposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, let me provide you with our financial outlook for the first quarter\n",
      "of 2009. As you know the macro-economic environment is very challenging these\n",
      "days and it has been compounded by the recent crisis in the financial markets.\n",
      "The fundamental however for the telecom industry remains unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bandwidth demand continues unimpeded in the access network and the migration\n",
      "towards next-gen IP networks is a key driving force in the core networks and\n",
      "we‚Äôll still being committing substantial investments on behalf of the network\n",
      "operators, so we remain optimistic about the industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "From EXFO‚Äôs perspective, we have not witnessed any major drop-off in our\n",
      "Telecom business with the exception of Verizon in the U.S. Verizon accounted\n",
      "for 7.4% of our sales in fiscal ‚Äô08, but we still manage to post a recorded\n",

      "Now looking at booking trends in the early part, for the first quarter of\n",
      "2009, once again we are witnessing softness at Verizon, while effectively\n",
      "solid everywhere else. It‚Äôs like our growth elsewhere is rather solid. Perhaps\n",
      "we‚Äôre seeing more orders push out or some order push out, but certainly not\n",
      "cancellations. One area of the concern maybe of our industry and life sciences\n",
      "division, which is showing science of less demand from customer driven\n",
      "products, like say phones and things of that nature that are actually\n",
      "assembled using our light curing systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this mixed marketing environment, the significant fluctuations in the\n",
      "Canadian dollars and I would say a slightly lower visibility than normal, we\n",
      "are forecasting sales between $45 million and $50 million in the first quarter\n",
      "of ‚Äô09 and we‚Äôre expecting GAAP net result between a loss of $0.03 per share\n",

      "\n",
      "First and foremost is Polycom‚Äôs strong balance sheet positioning us very well\n",

      "industry solutions makes Polycom an effective partner for customers of any\n",

      "\n",
      "Finally, before I turn the call over to Mike Kourey, I‚Äôd like to touch on our\n",
      "progress with Polycom‚Äôs operating model. As I discussed earlier, we believe\n",
      "Polycom is well positioned to serve as an important cost savings option for\n",
      "enterprise and government agencies alike. As you can see, this continues to\n",
      "have a positive impact on our top line results. In addition, as we stated last\n",
      "quarter, we were going to improve our gross margins and I‚Äôm pleased to say we\n",
      "returned to the over 60% level in Q3.\n",
      "\n",
      "From our operating cost perspective, as we indicated in our last call, we\n",
      "continue to build our go-to-market footprint particularly with customer facing\n",
      "hirers. Driven primarily by the fast ROI benefits of our solutions, we believe\n",
      "these investments will continue to enable us to capture the fast growth\n",
      "opportunity and unified collaboration and will allow us to make competitive\n",
      "gains in most, if not all our major product categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going forward, we expect revenue growth to outpace sales and marketing\n",
      "spending thereby reducing the expense to revenue ratio as we grow. As we\n",
      "forecasted, we reduced research and development spending in Q3. Of course, we\n",
      "continue to invest at a robust level in order to deliver industry leading\n",
      "innovations to our customers. I want to highlight that R&D is now within our\n",
      "target model range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, G&A continued to operate at a level that we believe is in balance with\n",
      "our revenue levels. The net result is that we delivered above forecast\n",
      "operating margins in the third quarter. Importantly I wanted to note that not\n",
      "only do I expect Polycom to deliver market leadership through the best unified\n",
      "collaboration solutions with a world class go-to-market but, I expect tangible\n",
      "progress in our operating model in 2009.\n",

      "Moving to revenue by geography, in the third quarter North America revenues\n",
      "were up 2% sequentially and 5% over the year ago period. EMEA revenues\n",

      "we are delighted with the strong sequential revenue growth of our network\n",

      "60.2% representing a sequential increase of 170 basis points.\n",
      "\n",
      "This significant improvement was driven by video product cost reductions,\n",

      "end of the third quarter same store sales were declining at almost a 17% rate.\n",
      "These trends are the result of an increasingly difficult operated environment\n",

      "this quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worsening revenue trends over this past quarter have been broad based\n",
      "across most geographies and industries served. Acquisitions completed during\n",
      "the last 12 months fueled our revenue during the quarter by contributing a 16%\n",
      "increase in revenue. We implemented additional cost cuts during the quarter\n",

      "results and expectations for the next quarter. Our strategy to grow revenue\n",
      "and income has included broadening our niche approach to serving the blue\n",
      "collar labor market in the following ways. First, serving the general labor\n",
      "needs with our 759 Labor Ready branches.\n",
      "\n",

      "And fifth, serving the aviation maintenance and manufacturing markets with\n",

      "Reducing our exposure to construction and reducing our exposure to just one\n",

      "will point out that our same branch revenue decline dropped from 12% in July\n",
      "to nearly 17% in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the fourth quarter of 2008, we expect revenue in the range of $325 million\n",
      "to $335 million. This represents growth from acquisitions completed within the\n",
      "last 12 months of 14% and a decline in organic revenue of about 21%. Resulting\n",
      "in a decrease in total revenue for Q4 this year of about 7% compared to the\n",
      "same quarter last year. Now let‚Äôs discuss the Transit Gross margin. Our gross\n",
      "margin for the quarter was 29.7%, consistent with our expectation. Pay rates\n",
      "have been growing faster than bill rates for several quarters as a result of\n",
      "minimum wage increases, a lower mix of construction business, and the\n",
      "competitive pricing environment associated with the slowing economy. Compared\n",
      "to Q3 last year, bill rates increased 1.9% and pay rates increased 2.8%\n",
      "resulting in the gap of 90 basis points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our estimate for gross margin for Q4 2008 is 29%. Selling, general, and\n",
      "administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was 22.2% this quarter which\n",
      "was above our expectation of 21.5%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was higher\n",
      "than expected for two reasons. First, revenue was lower than expected,\n",
      "resulting in a lower base to spread our fixed cost across. Second, we had $2.8\n",
      "million of restructuring expense related to decisions made during the quarter\n",
      "and not included in our initial estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excluding the restructuring expense from this quarter, our SG&A as a\n",
      "percentage of revenue would‚Äôve been 21.5% as expected. Now, due to the number\n",
      "of acquisitions over the last four quarters, I‚Äôm going to hit some key points\n",
      "that should be useful in understanding our SG&A results this quarter. First,\n",
      "total SG&A was $86.2 million this quarter which is a decrease of $2.9 million\n",
      "over the same quarter a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, included in our SG&A this quarter is incremental expense of $6.6\n",
      "million from acquisitions completed over the last 12 months. Excluding the\n",
      "incremental SG&A from acquisitions and the $2.8 million of restructuring\n",
      "expense, SG&A would have been about $76.8 million this quarter. This\n",
      "represents a decrease in our SG&A from core operations of about $11 million\n",
      "after adjusting Q3 of 2007 or $1.3 million of our restructuring expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put another way, we experienced a 13% decline in SG&A from core operations\n",
      "this quarter compared to Q3 of last year after adjustment for restructuring\n",
      "expenses recognized in both quarters. In regard to our expectation for the\n",
      "fourth quarter of 2008, we expect SG&A to be about 25% of revenue based on the\n",
      "revenue estimate provided today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Q4 SG&A expectation included approximately $1 million of additional\n",
      "restructuring expense. Interest income was $1.5 million lower than the same\n",
      "quarter last year, primarily due to lower yields on adjusted cash.\n",
      "Depreciation and amortization was $600,000 higher this quarter compared to Q3\n",
      "last year due to the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets\n",
      "acquired over the last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our income tax rate for the quarter was 37.2%, which was about what we\n",
      "expected. We expect our income tax rate for Q4 to be higher at about 38%. The\n",
      "higher rate is due to certain non-deductible expenses that now have a\n",
      "proportionately larger impact due to lower pre-tax income in comparison with\n",
      "prior periods. Diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 is\n",
      "estimated to be $0.10 to $0.14 and is based on an estimated weighted average\n",
      "share count for the fourth quarter of 42.8 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Q4 net income estimate represents about a 60% decline compared to the same\n",
      "period a year ago which is larger than the approximate 30% decline we\n",
      "recognized this quarter. I want to take a moment to point out the key factors\n",
      "driving the accelerated drop in net income we expect in Q4 this year. First we\n",
      "expect a Q4 organic revenue decline of about 21% versus our Q3 organic revenue\n",
      "decline of 17%. Second, we expect an increase of $1.2 million in our quarterly\n",
      "depreciation run rate due to the implementation of new systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, workers compensation expense as a percentage of revenue has been about\n",
      "4.1% this year, which is lower than the percentage we experienced Q1, Q2 and\n",
      "Q3 last year. However, since work comp dropped to 4.1% in Q4 last year, we are\n",
      "not expecting an incremental benefit to our gross margin likely experienced\n",
      "through the first three quarters of 2008. Fourth, Plane Techs has been an\n",
      "accretive acquisition for us in 2008. However, the first year accretion drops\n",
      "off in Q4 when we hit our one year anniversary of ownership.\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôll finish off here with some highlights on the cash flows and balance sheet.\n",
      "We finished the quarter with $57 million of cash which will continue to\n",
      "increase as we move through the fourth quarter as Q3 is our seasonal peak for\n",
      "accounts receivable. Year-to-date cash flow from operations declined by $10\n",
      "million which is consistent with our drop in net income. In regard to capital\n",
      "expenditures, we expect CapEx of about $6 million for Q4 this year. Our focus\n",
      "is centered on reducing our expense structure during these challenging\n",
      "economic times. It starts by closing or consolidating branches followed by\n",
      "scaling our field management and support costs to match. We will continue to\n",
      "aggressively reduce expenses to scale our cost structure to the level of\n",
      "demand for our services.\n",
      "\n",

      "even the biggest of big pharma despite of the hundreds of millions of dollars\n",
      "they have spent to find a therapy to improve outcome, HCC remains a large and\n",
      "deadly cancer. The selection of this indication by Celsion is not a\n",

      "\n",
      "HCC is the world‚Äôs fifth largest cancer and a disease with significant concern\n",

      "\n",
      "A check in point I want to make and equally important to the regulatory\n",
      "support, it‚Äôs clear that the clinical evidence for a successful HEAT trial is\n",

      "confirmatory endpoint particularly in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot emphasize enough the significance of this study unlike almost all\n",

      "treatment options particularly for patients with non-resectable disease. The\n",

      "doctors, payers and professional societies make their decisions, in part, on\n",
      "the publication of multiple independent clinical studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Dr. Bristow stated, we are especially excited that the sensitive detection\n",
      "of ovarian cancer was paired with the classification of most benign masses as\n",
      "low-risk, and greater than 95% confidence that a negative test will result in\n",
      "a benign pathology finding. The study also found a 91% detection of early\n",

      "\n",
      "Few companies in our states have made such rapid progress over such a short\n",

      "this perseverance has generated a groundbreaking record of accomplishments\n",
      "particularly in the development and the commercialization of multi-marker\n",
      "diagnostics. This includes the first ever FDA clearance of a proteomic-based\n",
      "IVDMIA.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then achieved Medicare coverage within weeks after the launch of OVA1 and\n",

      "now we are among the first class of MAAA algorithmic assets to achieve a\n",

      "operational improvements we have made with OVA1.\n",
      "\n",
      "As many of you know, the three common challenges inherent in the\n",
      "commercialization of any new diagnostic test or reimbursement, physician\n",
      "adoption and market education. So let‚Äôs discuss the steps our management team\n",
      "is taking to address these challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of reimbursement, on November 6, the clinical (inaudible) committee\n",
      "announced that CPT code test with an MAAA such as our test will be\n",
      "(inaudible), representing a two-year process of establishing long-term\n",
      "pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In anticipation of this process, during the early stage of the OVA1, we\n",
      "secured approval for reimbursement from Medicare at $516.25 per test, which is\n",
      "a common benchmark for reimbursement of a new diagnostic. We also established\n",
      "another benchmark with our Department of Defense at the stated list at $650\n",
      "per test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, we're very pleased to establish this range of pricing ahead of\n",
      "receiving our Category 1 CPT code. We now have the ability to drive the\n",
      "reimbursement at these price levels during the gap-fill process and having a\n",
      "CPT code (inaudible) to OVA1 will streamline claims processing and strengthen\n",
      "our reimbursement position.\n",
      "\n",
      "These developments provide us new information to engage [payers] in continued\n",
      "dialog. These discussions will revolve around an executive summary of the\n",
      "OVA500 study, the new Category 1 CPT code and have the pricing for over one\n",
      "should move forward in 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "We anticipate this for enhance payer recognition, contribute to more\n",
      "successful clients being processed as well as begin to resolve the lumpiness\n",
      "associated with claims build under our miscellaneous code. On previous calls,\n",
      "we had discussed our physician reorder rates to address if we had created a\n",
      "new program based on two key initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Quest Diagnostics have initiated a joint program focusing on six\n",
      "key state, one important element of the program is to identify physicians who\n",
      "are not reordering at a consistent rate and address their concerns and to\n",
      "reestablish OVA1 at top of mind as it means improved the use of everyone in\n",
      "their practice. We foresee the publication of the other 500 study to be a key\n",
      "catalyst in this program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we‚Äôve rolled out a claims assistance program designed to renew\n",
      "physicians‚Äô interest and reordering of OVA1 cases where patient bills will\n",
      "initiate. This program proactively assists a physician in [pill] and patient\n",
      "bills and thereby restores their confidence in ordering OVA1. We expect these\n",
      "two new initiatives to drive more consistent order impact and resulting in the\n",
      "OVA1 annuity which is the long-term goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, with [physicians] in creating a top position continues to be a\n",
      "challenge with more practices adopting a no fee policy and fewer physicians\n",
      "travelling to industry meeting. So to assist we have our client surrounded by\n",
      "campaign along with our recently launched educational webinar series that is\n",
      "available on-demand on the OVA1 website along with OVA1 case study.\n",
      "\n",
      "This provides the physicians the freedom to learn that their convenience.\n",
      "Quest Diagnostic is also launching a similar OVA1 webinar program later this\n",
      "month. These webinars are a cost effective evolution to our marketing program\n",
      "that will reach more physician especially those in the academic and those key\n",
      "facilities as well as those located in rural areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "These programs that support [coding] clients processing and physician\n",
      "adoptions further strengthen our OVA1 commercialization efforts. However, we\n",
      "don‚Äôt expect to begin realizing the full impact of these programs until after\n",
      "the CPT code goes into effect early next year. So for the fourth quarter, we\n",
      "expect stable to slightly growing use of OVA1 ranging from 4,100 to 4,400\n",
      "tests to be performed. This also takes into account a fewer number of business\n",
      "days in the quarter due to holiday and the recent weather events affecting the\n",
      "North Eastern state.\n",
      "\n",
      "In closing, I would like to note that in addition to grow organically these\n",
      "efforts or strategies, programs and initiatives, we have kept an eye to\n",
      "possible M&A transactions. We always consider opportunities that have merit\n",
      "and compliment our business, keeping in mind our ultimate goal of creating\n",

      "SEAMLESS Phase 3 study in AML surpassed 100 patients achieving an important\n",
      "milestone. With the randomized stage of SEAMLESS currently reaching its first\n",
      "anniversary, we are encouraged to see that the study has strong support by\n",
      "participating investigators.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a high unmet medical need for the treatment of elderly patients with\n",
      "AML, as the disease is associated with high mortality and poor quality of\n",
      "life. Currently, there is no standard or satisfactory treatment for this group\n",
      "of patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we continue to enroll in SEAMLESS, we look forward to reporting at the\n",
      "upcoming 2012 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology updated\n",
      "survival data from the entire population enrolled in the pilot and lead-in\n",
      "stage of SEAMLESS. These patients have the same entry criteria and receive\n",
      "sapacitabine administered in alternating cycles with decitabine or the same\n",
      "dosing regimen as those randomized to the experimental Arm A of SEAMLESS. This\n",
      "data provides an updated safety and efficacy of this treatment regimen of\n",
      "sapacitabine administered in alternating cycles with decitabine in a\n",
      "multicenter setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to AML, we are also exploring sapacitabine in patients with\n",
      "myelodysplastic syndromes or MDS. We recently reported updated Phase 2 data\n",
      "indicating that the survival of all the patients treated with sapacitabine\n",
      "exceeded the expected survival of patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk\n",
      "MDS after treatment failure of front-line hypomethylating agents or HMAs\n",
      "reported in literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following up on these promising results, we will be preparing regulatory\n",
      "submissions with the goal of defining a registration pathway for sapacitabine\n",
      "in patients with MDS after HMA treatment failure. We are encouraged that the\n",

      "\n",
      "Thank you, Spiro. First, let me outline the design of our Phase 3 study.\n",
      "SEAMLESS is a two-arm randomized Phase 3 registration directed trial comparing\n",
      "the regimens of all sapacitabine dosed in alternating cycles with intravenous\n",
      "decitabine versus intravenous decitabine alone, as the front-line treatment in\n",
      "patients with newly diagnosed AML.\n",
      "\n",
      "SEAMLESS is expected to enroll approximately 485 elderly patients aged 70\n",
      "years or older who are not candidates for, or have refused intensive induction\n",
      "therapy. The study is being conducted under SPA or Special Protocol Assessment\n",
      "agreement that we reached with the US FDA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The randomized stage of SEAMLESS was initiated in October 2011 following a\n",
      "favorable review of the available data from a pilot Phase 1/2 study and the\n",
      "lead-in part of SEAMLESS by the independent monitoring committee or DSMB. The\n",
      "primary endpoint of the study is an improvement in overall survival. An\n",
      "interim analysis for futility by the independent committee is planned when 212\n",
      "events have occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the quarter, we continued to open additional study sites in the US\n",
      "bringing the total to 36. In terms of enrollment, we recently surpassed 100\n",
      "patients. We continue to be encouraged by the support and interest of\n",
      "investigators and patients in the SEAMLESS study. As you know, decitabine is\n",
      "used in both arms of SEAMLESS and we are encouraged by the recent approvals of\n",
      "decitabine in Europe for patients with AML aged 65 years or older.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November, the results from a Phase 2 randomized trial of single-agent\n",
      "sapacitabine in elderly patients aged 70 years or older with newly diagnosed\n",
      "AML or AML in first relapse were published in The Lancet Oncology. The\n",
      "published study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of sapacitabine in this\n",
      "patient population.\n",
      "\n",
      "In parallel with enrolling patient in SEAMLESS, we are also evaluating\n",
      "sapacitabine's therapeutic utility in other potential indications both as a\n",
      "single agent and in combinations. Sapacitabine's activity in both\n",

      "Oracles Taleo/Fusion product. But GUESS wanted the best solution for their\n",
      "people, and they decided that solution was Cornerstone. This led them to\n",
      "purchase both our learning and performance clouds to manage learning,\n",
      "performance, succession planning, and compensation for their entire employee\n",
      "population. Ricoh America is another Oracle client also chose Cornerstone in\n",
      "the third quarter. Ricoh was using a number of these disparate learning\n",
      "systems to train more than 47,000 employees and sought to bring these\n",

      "independent customer service agents after leveraging our learning cloud to\n",
      "train 33,000 internal users for just over a year. We believe these deals not\n",

      "RNA level was fairly common across all groups at 6.5 logs, and a majority of\n",
      "the patients in this study actually had the more difficult to treat genotype\n",
      "1a infection, which range from 59% to 70.7% in the different treatment groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "This slide shows the primary results of the study based on intention-to-treat\n",
      "analysis for the 8- and 12-week arms. The first point worth mentioning is that\n",
      "across all the groups, very high rates of SVR12 were observed, ranging from\n",
      "85.4% up to 97.5% in the various treatment-na√Øve groups and up to 93.3% in the\n",
      "null responder groups. The optimal regimen that contained 3 direct-acting\n",
      "antivirals and ribavirin resulted in 97.5% SVR12 in treatment-na√Øve patients\n",
      "and 93.3% in the null responder group.\n",
      "\n",
      "More data about the response rates and some of the individual features are\n",
      "shown on this slide. As you can see, breakthroughs were rare. And only 3\n",
      "patients had virological breakthrough in the null responder group treated with\n",
      "450 ritonavir, 267, 333 and ribavirin as shown on the last slide -- last\n",
      "column. Relapses were primarily observed only in patients who received 8 weeks\n",
      "of therapy as shown on the third line. However, in patients that received the\n",
      "optimal regimen of 3 direct-acting antivirals and ribavirin, only one patient\n",
      "in the treatment-na√Øve group relapsed and no patient in the null responder\n",
      "group relapsed. When we look at the optimal treatment regimen, we saw that\n",
      "intent-to-treat results showed 97.5% SVR12 in the 3 DAA and ribavirin group\n",
      "and observed data results of 98.7%. The comparable results in the null\n",
      "responders, a much more difficult to treat group historically, was almost as\n",
      "good at 93.3% for both ITT and observed data results.\n",
      "\n",
      "This slide shows the breakdown of results for patients with HCV subtype 1A\n",
      "versus 1b. It is generally believed that 1b patients are easier to treat. And\n",
      "it was very interesting to note that in almost every category of treatment\n",
      "assignment, approximately 100% of patients or 100% of patients achieved SVR12.\n",
      "And in fact, in only one of the groups of genotype 1b was observed data SVR12\n",
      "not 100%, and in this case, it was 96%. These data suggest that for patients\n",
      "with genotype 1b, regimens that might avoid ribavirin or might use fewer DAAs\n",
      "could be considered in future trials. Furthermore, when we look at the optimal\n",
      "treatment regimen of ABT-450 ritonavir, 267, 333 and ribavirin, we saw\n",
      "excellent results of SVR12. Even in the more difficult to treat genotype 1a\n",
      "patients and even in the null responders with genotype 1a, 89% of patients\n",
      "achieved an SVR12, which is encouraging as a clinician and researcher and\n",
      "provides hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "We examined the results for SVR12 by IL28 genotype. And the short answer is\n",
      "that IL28B CC versus non-CC does not appear to influence very much the results\n",
      "of treatment in this particular study. As you can see, there are very high\n",
      "rates of SVR12, and there do not appear to be any significant differences\n",
      "between CC versus non-CC patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Resistance analysis has been conducted and is ongoing in the 8- and 12-week\n",
      "treatment arms. In the 8-week arm, so far, no treatment emergent resistance-\n",
      "associated variants have been seen in relapse samples from 6 of 9 patients.\n",
      "And in the 12-week treatment arms, the majority of breakthrough and relapse\n",
      "samples have showed emergence of variants known to be selected by ABT-450, 267\n",
      "or 333. Although this is in a very small number of cases, ongoing studies plan\n",
      "to examine the resistance profile in more detail and will be presented\n",
      "subsequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd now like to turn to adverse events and laboratory abnormalities and\n",
      "address safety issues. No study drug-related serious adverse events were\n",
      "noted. One serious adverse event, namely arthralgia, possibly related to study\n",
      "medication, was noted in a 24-week treatment arm patient. However, only 2 of\n",
      "448 patients have discontinued treatment due to AEs attributed to study drug\n",
      "by the investigator. These 2 are characterized by cholestatic hepatitis in a\n",
      "patient with gallstones and a second patient with a range of different\n",
      "symptoms. Both events resolved, and both patients achieved sustained\n",
      "biological response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moderate-to-severe adverse events, possibly or probably related to study drug,\n",
      "with a greater-than-5% incidence in any arm, are shown on this slide. Fatigue,\n",
      "headache, insomnia and nausea were the most common adverse events described\n",
      "and were infrequently noted, with the exception of one group, where it was\n",
      "noted in approximately 8%. In the majority of the groups, it was 5% or less.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities occurring in more than one patient in\n",
      "the 8- and 12-week arms are shown here. The only laboratory abnormality that\n",
      "occurred with any frequency was an elevation in total bilirubin, which was\n",
      "noted in 6.7% of the treatment-na√Øve patients and 12.2% of the null\n",
      "responders. The elevation in total bilirubin in the vast majority of cases was\n",
      "less than 3 grams per -- milligrams per deciliter in total, was predominantly\n",
      "indirect and resolves spontaneously without any adjustment, discontinuation or\n",
      "interruption of therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few patients were noted to have an elevation of serum ALT, as noted on the\n",
      "second line. In most of these cases, these ALT elevations spontaneously\n",
      "resolved by 2 to 3 weeks, and in no case, was the elevation in ALT associated\n",
      "with an increase in serum bilirubin. The other adverse laboratory\n",
      "abnormalities noted on this slide are listed. And as you can see, they\n",
      "occurred quite infrequently, and in no case, was study drug interrupted or\n",
      "discontinued [ph] because of these laboratory abnormalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "We noted with interest that the ribavirin-free arms had no significant\n",
      "decrease in serum hemoglobin compared to the ribavirin-containing arms, where\n",
      "the mean change in hemoglobin was approximately a 2-gram reduction as shown on\n",
      "this slide. We noted significantly smaller mean hemoglobin decrease at week\n",
      "12, lower incidence of hemoglobin decrease to less than 10 grams per deciliter\n",
      "and a trend towards fewer events of anemia, insomnia, nausea and cough in the\n",
      "ribavirin-free arms. These data support particularly in easier-to-treat\n",
      "populations and as part of our ongoing study designs, consideration of\n",
      "ribavirin-free regimens in the treatment development.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the 12-week, 3 direct-acting antiviral and ribavirin regimen\n",
      "showed the greatest efficacy for both treatment-na√Øve and null-responder\n",
      "populations. In the genotype 1a-infected treatment-naive patients and infected\n",
      "null responders, which are traditionally more difficult to treat, SVR12 ITT\n",
      "rates of 96% and 89%, respectively, were described, which are encouraging.\n",
      "High SVR12 rates were seen across all IL28B genotypes. We noted with interest\n",
      "that in the 124 genotype 1b-infected treatment-naive or null-responder\n",
      "patients in any of the 12-week treatment arms, there were no virological\n",
      "failures. The combination of ABT-450 ritonavir, 267 and 333, therefore, will\n",
      "be studied both with and without ribavirin in planned Phase III trials. And a\n",
      "co-formulated tablet, containing ABT-450 ritonavir and 267, will be used in\n",
      "Phase III trials going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to knowledge that safety was studied extensively, and these\n",
      "combinations appear to be well tolerated through 8 to 12 weeks of treatment,\n",
      "the most common adverse events for fatigue, headache, insomnia and nausea. As\n",
      "expected, we did note transient asymptomatic elevation of indirect bilirubin,\n",
      "which seemed to resolve spontaneously and was consistent with the previously\n",
      "known effect of ABT-450 ritonavir on the bilirubin transporter, OATP1B1. And\n",
      "it appeared that fewer than 1% of patients discontinued due to adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to acknowledge the co-investigators coordinators and patients,\n",
      "who participated in this study. Thank you for your attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scott C. Brun**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Dr. Kowdley, for both this presentation, as well as the excellent\n",
      "job you did at the late breakout session of the AASLD meeting. And thank you,\n",
      "everyone, for joining us today. I think you can see from the data that Dr.\n",
      "Kowdley just outlined, we're very pleased with the efficacy demonstrated in\n",
      "the Phase IIb Aviator study. These are very strong results, and they\n",
      "demonstrate that our interferon-free regimen offers the potential for a\n",
      "compelling and clinically relevant improvement over current treatments for\n",
      "patients with genotype 1 infection. What I'd like to do over the next few\n",
      "minutes is to provide some additional context on the data to date and walk\n",
      "through the details of our recently initiated global Phase III registrational\n",
      "program, which will be conducted in genotype 1 patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the slide, as a remainder, our HCV program contains compounds that span 3\n",
      "mechanisms of action, including our boosted protease inhibitor, ABT-450; our\n",
      "NS5A inhibitor, ABT-267; and our non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, ABT-333.\n",
      "As we previously have stated, our goal remains to bring to market a potent,\n",
      "well-tolerated and easy-to-administer treatment that delivers very high cure\n",
      "rates without requiring the use of interferon and across the most represented\n",
      "of patient populations globally, including very importantly, those who are\n",
      "traditionally the hardest to treat. The data that have been presented to date\n",
      "confirm that we're very well on target to achieve that particular goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Phase IIb Aviator study represents the most comprehensive set of\n",
      "interferon-free, DAA combination treatment data in genotype 1 patients that\n",
      "has been available to date. The study was designed to examine a variety of\n",
      "regimens across different patient populations in order to answer multiple\n",
      "questions and to support the selection of optimal interferon-free regimens for\n",
      "Phase III confirmatory studies. The results from the Aviator trial, build upon\n",
      "earlier findings from our Phase II pilot and co-pilot studies, with Aviator\n",
      "demonstrating very strong efficacy across all treatment arms in both genotype\n",
      "1 na√Øve, and of particular importance, pegylated interferon-experienced\n",
      "patients. Now from a safety perspective, all regimens were well tolerated with\n",
      "very few patients in the study discontinuing treatment due to adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now with these strong results in hand and following discussions with\n",
      "regulatory authorities around the world, we've recently initiated our\n",
      "comprehensive genotype 1 registrational program with the start of our very\n",
      "first Phase III study. And we're well on track to begin all of the remaining\n",
      "registrational trials in the coming weeks. Our global program will include\n",
      "study of na√Øve and experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, as well\n",
      "as certain special populations, including patients with cirrhosis. We're going\n",
      "to evaluate our 3 direct-acting antivirals, both with and without ribavirin,\n",
      "for 12 weeks. Our Phase III triple DAA regimen consequently includes very\n",
      "notably a successfully co-formulated, 2-tablet regimen of our protease\n",
      "inhibitor, ABT-450, with low-dose ritonavir; and our NS5A inhibitor, ABT-267.\n",
      "So again, all 3 active ingredients in the same co-formulation administered\n",
      "once daily. Patients will also receive our polymerase inhibitor, ABT-333,\n",
      "given as one tablet twice daily. And once again, I'd like to emphasize that we\n",
      "will be evaluating regimens both with and without ribavirin. Now this Phase\n",
      "III program is broad. It's comprehensive. It is going to include more than\n",
      "2,000 patients and span 29 countries around the globe.\n",
      "\n",
      "To walk you the specifics on this slide of our genotype 1 registrational\n",
      "program, there will be 6 studies included. As noted on the slide, the first 2\n",
      "studies, named SAPPHIRE-I and II 2, are both placebo-controlled trials\n",
      "evaluating our triple DAA regimen plus ribavirin in genotype 1a and 1b\n",
      "treatment-na√Øve as well as treatment-experienced patients. In the next group\n",
      "of trials, we have 3: SAPPHIRE-III, SAPPHIRE IV, and PEARL-II 2. And these\n",
      "will explore ribavirin-free treatment across a variety of populations. Each of\n",
      "these 5 studies, I want to stress, is 12 weeks in duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, in the TURQUOISE-II study, we'll evaluate our 3 DAA combination with\n",
      "ribavirin in compensated cirrhotic patients, including both na√Øve and\n",
      "experienced genotype 1a and 1b patients. And this study will include not only\n",
      "12 but also a 24-week duration of therapy. Additionally, while not part of the\n",
      "initial registration package, we are also planning a Phase III study called\n",
      "TURQUOISE-I, which will be conducted in HIV and HCV co-infected patients.\n",
      "Similar to TURQUOISE-II, this regimen will include the 12- and 24-week courses\n",
      "of therapy and will include our triple DAA regimen with ribavirin. Now just as\n",
      "a reminder, genotype 1 is the most prevalent HCV genotype in key developed\n",
      "markets, and it represents more than 70% of patients in the U.S., as well as\n",
      "more than 60% of patients in Western Europe. The timing of our registrational\n",
      "study supports commercialization in the early 2015 time frame, which puts us\n",
      "in a very strong competitive position. It's our stated goal and intent to be\n",
      "the first to launch an interferon-free regimen for genotype 1 patients through\n",
      "the conduct of this registrational program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now our Phase III combination offers a much simpler treatment for patients\n",
      "versus today's standard of care. Our regimen is compact, including a total of\n",
      "4 pills, plus or minus ribavirin, for only 12 weeks' duration. Now in\n",
      "contrast, the current standard of care requires up to 48 weeks of treatment,\n",
      "including weekly interferon injections, a direct-acting antiviral administered\n",
      "3x a day with food, plus ribavirin administered twice daily. And as you're\n",
      "likely aware, treatment with interferon is difficult for many to tolerate.\n",
      "Side effects can range from fatigue and sleep disturbances to depression,\n",
      "anxiety, irritability, as well as personality changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Dr. Kowdley outlined, all regimens in the Aviator study were well tolerated\n",
      "with an overall rate of drug-related discontinuations of less than 1%. Across\n",
      "our entire development program, discontinuations for any reason have been very\n",
      "low. Additionally, we have not seen gastrointestinal or lipid side effects of\n",
      "the type that have been observed with the use of ritonavir in the HIV setting.\n",
      "Low-dosed ritonavir pharmacokinetic enhancement allows for higher drug levels,\n",
      "and we believe this approach helps us to achieve the high cure rates that\n",
      "we've observed with this regimen to date. And remember, unlike HIV treatment,\n",
      "which is chronic, this is a 12-week short course of therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we have an extensive drug-drug interaction program that will\n",
      "provide guidance on how to use our regimen and relevant concomitant\n",
      "medications, including treatments used in population such as of those with HIV\n",
      "co-infection and in the post-transplant setting. As I mentioned, we plan to\n",
      "conduct a Phase III study in HIV-HCV co-infected patients, and we expect to\n",
      "start that trial next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I'd like to move on to briefly mention our other ongoing trials, as well\n",
      "as our next-generation Hepatitis C Program, which will be moving into the\n",
      "clinic very soon -- very shortly. As Dr. Kowdley outlined, in Aviator, we saw\n",
      "very high rates of cure in genotype 1b patients. Now to be specific, we saw no\n",
      "virologic failures in any of the 12-week treatment arms with this population,\n",
      "including the ribavirin-free arm.So we recognize that some patient populations\n",
      "may respond very well to even more simplified regimens without compromising\n",
      "the strong efficacy evident in the Aviator trial. Now as such, we're actively\n",
      "evaluating a 2 DAA once-daily, ribavirin-free regimen of our co-formulated\n",
      "protease and NS5A inhibitors in genotype 1b patients in an ongoing Phase II\n",
      "trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really also want to mention that we have an active clinical program in\n",
      "Japan, where we're currently in Phase II development. Our study in Japan\n",
      "includes patients with genotype 1b, as well as genotype 2 infection, which are\n",
      "the most common forms of hepatitis C in Japanese patients. We're evaluating\n",
      "12- and 24-week interferon, as well as ribavirin-free treatment regimens that\n",
      "contain boosted ABT-450 and ABT-267 administered once daily. And importantly,\n",
      "we're looking to expand as interferon, ribavirin-free, once-daily treatment\n",
      "into other countries across Asia where we see similar viral epidemiology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's our Navigator study, which evaluates our boosted ABT-450 and\n",
      "ABT-267 regimen, with and without ribavirin, in genotypes 2 and 3. It's\n",
      "ongoing, and we expect results in 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now finally, I'd like to mention that we also have a very compelling, next-\n",
      "generation program under way, something we haven't spoken about much in the\n",
      "past. But we have compounds entering human trials in the coming weeks. On pre-\n",
      "clinical studies, these promising assets have shown broad genotypic activity,\n",
      "including activity against isolates that have resistance to first-generation\n",
      "DAAs. Our next-generation assets also support once-daily dosing without\n",
      "ritonavir, as well as the ability to co-formulate. Probably you can see from\n",
      "all of these programs, we're very committed to this therapeutic category. And\n",
      "we're going to continue to work to evolve the treatment paradigm over the\n",
      "years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "So to sum up, Aviator represents the largest and most comprehensive\n",
      "interferon-free data set presented to date with SVR12 data. The results\n",
      "separate our regimen from competitive approaches in a number of genotype 1\n",
      "populations, including importantly, the most difficult-to-treat, prior-\n",
      "interferon, null-responder patients. Now as you know, the HCV landscape has\n",
      "changed significantly over the past year. And it certainly continues to\n",
      "evolve. Based on what we've seen with competitor programs, we continue to have\n",
      "a high level of confidence that we have the potential to achieve a strong\n",
      "leadership position in this very, very promising therapeutic space.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with that, I'd like to go ahead and turn it back to John Thomas, who will\n",
      "open the call up for questions you might have.\n",
      "\n",
      "**John B. Thomas**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Scott. In addition to Dr. Kowdley and Dr. Brun, we also have with us\n",
      "Dr. Barry Bernstein on the line to help answer questions. Dr. Bernstein is the\n",
      "Head of Infectious Disease Development and the Project Director for Abbott's\n",

      "TO-2061 is an adjunctive therapy that is being evaluated in the treatment of\n",
      "patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. We have not adequately responded\n",
      "to an approved OCD medication. We believe that the potential benefits of\n",
      "TO-2061 may be related to the ability of the drug to down regulate dopamine\n",
      "even at very low doses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our investment in the program is based on the result of two pilot studies in\n",

      "continued build out and investment in our international business will further\n",
      "drive and sustain a long-term growth. These investments have had a short term\n",
      "impact on our margins. We believe that it‚Äôs necessary and critical for us to\n",
      "undertake in order to position ourselves for future growth. We remain\n",
      "confident that 2013 will be another inflection point in revenue contribution\n",
      "from these markets. In fact, we are starting to see great traction in the\n",
      "retail markets. It‚Äôs a very important channel for us. For example, with one of\n",

      "2012 and this mark the sixth consecutive quarters since IPO that we delivered\n",
      "on above promise to our shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the third quarter, we again saw a strong user growth and reached to new\n",
      "heights in all three sets of operating metrics that we disclose. Our\n",
      "accumulative registered user accounts reached almost 242 million at the end of\n",
      "third quarter up 97% year-over-year and 19% sequentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overseas users now account for 41% of total registered user accounts up from\n",
      "36% at the end of the third quarter of 2011 and 40% at the end of the previous\n",

      "the third quarter of this year, up 98% year-over-year and 22% sequentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "Active user accounts continue to make up about 35% of the registered user base\n",
      "and the breakdown between China and overseas are similar to that of registered\n",
      "user accounts. So those ratios have been quite constant for the past two\n",
      "years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our average monthly paying user accounts were about $8.2 million for the third\n",
      "quarter this year, up 65% year-over-year and $0.11 sequentially. Overseas\n",
      "paying users now account for 32% of the total paying users compared with 30%\n",
      "for the third quarter of last year and 30% for the previous quarter. The\n",
      "conversion ratio from active to paying users was 9.7% compared with 10.7% from\n",
      "the previous quarter and we had yet to turn the payment option in certain\n",
      "markets while experiencing strong active user growth across all markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also in the third quarter, we increased our pre-load or pre-installation\n",
      "effort for the China open market channel with a free version of NQ Mobile\n",
      "products which result in a rapid increase in active users who have not yet\n",
      "been converted to paying users.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I discussed in the previous earnings calls, we would continue to experience\n",
      "fluctuations in both directions as we expand globally and adopt different\n",
      "market strategies. The overall increase in our user base was driven by both\n",
      "external factors such as the growth in the Smartphone industry, the continued\n",
      "proliferation of mobile internet applications and increased awareness of\n",
      "mobile security among consumers worldwide. It also reflects our execution\n",
      "ability to establish effective user acquisition and payment channels and to\n",
      "continuously improve existing products and launch new products to build user\n",
      "attraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now on to the financials. Total net revenues were about $26 million in the\n",
      "third quarter, up about 127% year-over-year and 29% sequentially. The\n",
      "increases were mainly due to the strong growth in revenues from premium mobile\n",
      "international services, revenues from other services and also revenue\n",
      "contribution from NationSky, which amounted to $4.5 million in the third\n",
      "quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Net revenues from premium mobile internet services increased 77% year-over-\n",
      "year and 14% sequentially to about $18 million in the third quarter of this\n",
      "year. The increases were primarily due to the strong and steady growth in the\n",
      "number of paying user accounts which reflected growth in the number of\n",
      "registered and active user accounts as well as increased use of NQ Mobile‚Äôs\n",
      "premium services, particularly among overseas paying user accounts, which\n",
      "generally pay a higher subscription fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue contribution from overseas users accounted for 54% of total net\n",
      "revenue from premium mobile internet services in the third quarter this year\n",
      "compared with 50% in the same period a year ago and 51% in the previous\n",
      "quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of average revenue per user or ARPU is measured on a quarterly basis,\n",
      "our blended quarterly ARPU were $2.24 for third quarter of this year compared\n",
      "with $2.08 for the same period a year ago and $2.18 for the previous quarter.\n",
      "ARPU for domestic China users were $1.52 for the third quarter up this year\n",
      "compared with $1.5 for the same period a year ago and $1.51 for the previous\n",
      "quarter. So it has been quite stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "ARPU for overseas users was $3.75 for the third quarter of this year compared\n",
      "with $3.01 for the same period a year ago and $3.73 for the previous quarter.\n",
      "Just like the conversion ratios from active to paying for overseas users,\n",
      "overseas ARPU also tend to fluctuate because it depends on the pricing\n",
      "strategy we set in each country and the timing return to billing switch. But\n",
      "as the overseas pricing is generally higher than China and overseas revenue\n",
      "carries more and more weight, we expect the blended ARPU to trend up over\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Net revenues from other services in third quarter which include revenues from\n",
      "NationSky increased 643% year-over-year and 91% sequentially to $7.4 million.\n",
      "So, excluding the net revenues of $4.5 million from NationSky, net revenues\n",
      "from other services were $2.9 million representing an increase of 197% year-\n",
      "over-year and 20% sequentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "The increases were mainly due to the growth in revenues from secured download\n",
      "and delivery services for mobile applications produced by third-parties. The\n",
      "revenues from NationSky increased 218.0% sequentially to $4.5 million in the\n",
      "third quarter due to the strong growth in its enterprise business and new\n",
      "customer gains. Also the last quarter revenue for NationSky only includes a\n",
      "month of June post to the completion of the acquisitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "So excluding the revenue from NationSky, net revenues from other services as a\n",
      "percentage of total net revenue was 14% in the third quarter of 2012, compared\n",
      "with 9% in same period a year ago and 13% in the previous quarter. So before\n",
      "moving onto the cost of revenues and operating expenses, I want to refer you\n",
      "to our disclosure, our non-GAAP financial measure which was included in our\n",
      "official press release, so only difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP\n",
      "numbers our share based compensation or SBC expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "So SBC expenses included across cost of revenues and operating expenses on a\n",
      "GAAP basis but excluded to derive our non-GAAP numbers. Most of the SBC\n",
      "expenses are incurred in operating expense line items and we have included a\n",
      "reconciliation table in our earnings release showing the detailed calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost of revenues in the third quarter was $8 million, representing an increase\n",
      "of 264% increase year-over-year and 70% sequentially. Excluding $3.4 million\n",
      "of NationSky's contribution, cost of revenues increased 110% year-over-year\n",
      "and 28% sequentially to $4.6 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "The year-over-year and sequential increases were primarily due to increased\n",
      "customer acquisition cost as a result of more users acquired in the third\n",
      "quarter and higher revenue sharing with mobile internet service providers\n",
      "consistent with the increase of revenue from them. Gross profit in the third\n",
      "quarter was $17.8 million, representing an increase of 95% year-over-year and\n",
      "17% sequentially. Gross margin or gross profit as a percentage of net revenues\n",
      "was about 70% in third quarter of this year, compared with 81% for same period\n",
      "a year ago and 77% in the previous quarter. Excluding the impact of NationSky,\n",
      "gross margin was about 79% and 81% in the third and second quarter of 2012\n",
      "respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "So given NationSky‚Äôs lower margin business nature, gross margin is expected to\n",
      "decline further in the fourth quarter of 2012 as NationSky‚Äôs revenues\n",
      "contribution becomes greater. NationSky‚Äôs gross margin in the third quarter\n",
      "and second quarter of 2012 were about 25% and 20% on a standalone basis\n",
      "respectively. And the cost of revenues for NationSky primarily consists of the\n",
      "hardware device procurement cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now on to the operating expenses; for the third quarter of 2012, third quarter\n",
      "of 2011 and second quarter of 2012; we recorded total SBC expenses of $7.8\n",
      "million, $2.7 million and $5 million respectively; of course the three\n",
      "operating expenses line. A significantly higher SBC in the third quarter of\n",
      "this year was primarily due to the SBC impact of newly hired executives and\n",
      "employees and acquisition of NationSky, which are also the main reasoning\n",
      "contributing to the GAAP operating loss we had this quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "So to make the quarterly comparison more consistent, I would like to address\n",
      "the following line items on a non-GAAP basis which excludes SBC expenses. The\n",
      "non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses were about $5 million in the third\n",
      "quarter, representing an increase of 252% year-over-year and 40% sequentially.\n",
      "The year-over-year and sequential increases were primarily due to higher\n",
      "marketing and advertising spending and higher staff costs as a result of\n",
      "increase in salary and headcount.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses were $4 million in the third\n",
      "quarter, representing an increase of 92% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.\n",
      "The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher staff costs from\n",
      "salary and headcount increases, higher legal and professional fees and higher\n",
      "consulting fees resulting from acquisitions and investment activities made\n",
      "from the second quarter of 2012; while the 10% sequential increase was\n",
      "primarily due to the higher staff costs, higher traveling and the\n",
      "entertainment cost, partially offset by lower office related expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "So non-GAAP research and development expenses was $2.3 million in the third\n",
      "quarter, representing an increase of 123% year-over-year and 35% sequentially.\n",
      "The year-over-year and sequential increases were primarily due to higher staff\n",
      "costs from salary and headcount increases. So as a result, non-GAAP operating\n",
      "income was $6.8 million in the third quarter this year, representing an\n",
      "increase of 44% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income\n",
      "was 26.4% in the third quarter of this year, compared with 41.6% in the third\n",
      "quarter of 2011 and 32.8% in second quarter of 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "So excluding the impact from NationSky, non-GAAP operating margin was 29.8%\n",
      "and 34.5% in the third quarter and second quarter of this year respectively.\n",
      "NationSky‚Äôs operating margin was about 10.3% and 10.4% on standalone basis in\n",
      "the third and second quarter of 2012 respectively. We had a foreign exchange\n",
      "loss of 0.2 million in the third quarter, compared with a gain of 1.6 million\n",
      "in the same period a year ago and a loss of 0.3 million in the previous\n",
      "quarter. The foreign exchange loss was primary attributable to the\n",
      "depreciation of RMB against US dollars, as a significant portion of IPO\n",
      "proceeds were converted in to RMB and placed in bank deposits since the second\n",
      "quarter of 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we continue to record interest income in the third quarter, resulted from\n",
      "our strong cash and deposit position. Interest income was 0.8 million in the\n",
      "third quarter of this year, compared with 0.5 million in the same period a\n",
      "year ago and 0.8 million in the previous quarter. So the significant year-\n",
      "over-year increase was primarily due to the higher term deposit position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Income tax expenses were 0.3 million compared with 0.08 million in the same\n",
      "period a year ago and 0.12 million in the previous quarter. So the sequential\n",
      "and year-over-year increase are mainly due to the more taxable profit\n",
      "generated; and we expect our effective income tax to remain relatively low for\n",
      "the remainder of 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "The net income attributable to NQ Mobile was 0.3 million in the third quarter,\n",
      "compared with 4.3 million in the same period a year ago and 2.1 million in the\n",
      "previous quarter. Again the decline in net income is mostly due to higher SBC\n",
      "expenses in the third quarter. Non-GAAP net income attributable to NQ Mobile\n",
      "was 8.1 million in the third quarter, compared with 7 million in the same\n",
      "period a year ago and 7.1 million in the previous quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "On EPS basis, our third quarter GAAP earnings per ADS is about $0.01 on a\n",
      "diluted basis and a non-GAAP earnings per ADS is about $0.16. In the third\n",
      "quarter of 2012, we continue to generate strong cash flows; our net cash flow\n",
      "generated from operations for third quarter was 6.9 million compared with 2.6\n",
      "million for same period a year ago and 1.9 million for the previous quarter.\n",
      "As of September 30, 2012 the company had a total cash position of about 126\n",
      "million; about 35 million cash and cash equivalents and a 91 million term\n",
      "deposits and differed revenue of 10.9 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "So looking forward to the fourth quarter of 2012 and beyond, we expect net\n",
      "revenues to be in the range of 28.5 million and 29.5 million for the fourth\n",
      "quarter of 2012; thereby raising our net revenue guidance for the full year\n",
      "2012 from the previous issued range of 86 million to 89 million to the new\n",
      "range of 90 million to 91 million. And the company also initiates its revenue\n",

      "\n",
      "Today, I'll summarize our fourth quarter performance. I'm also going to update\n",
      "you on the integration of Gen-Probe, including our expectations for synergies,\n",
      "review the market adoption of our Dimensions 3D tomo system and provide a\n",
      "brief review of some of the other key businesses. Glenn will then give you a\n",

      "fiscal 2013 guidance. We'll then open up the call for 30 minutes for Q&A.\n",
      "\n",
      "So from a quarterly performance perspective, total revenues, including 2\n",
      "months of Gen-Probe, increased 28.5% to $600 million on a non-GAAP basis.\n",
      "Excluding the revenue contribution from Gen-Probe during the quarter, legacy\n",
      "Hologic revenues were $499 million, which exceeded our guidance of $485\n",
      "million and represented growth of 7% on a year-over-year basis. Our revenue\n",
      "outperformance was fueled by growth in all 4 business segments: strong Breast\n",
      "Health sales driven by both solid service revenues and conversion to 2D and 3D\n",
      "Dimensions; robust Diagnostics growth, including ThinPrep and our legacy HPV\n",
      "products; high-single-digit year-over-year growth in Surgical, led by strong\n",
      "MyoSure growth and an increase in NovaSure; and finally, increased Skeletal\n",
      "Health revenues in the high single digits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-GAAP earnings of $0.37, including Gen-Probe, were $0.01 higher than the\n",
      "top of our guidance, nearly 11% over last year. Gen-Probe contributed $0.01 to\n",
      "quarterly EPS.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to now discuss some of the individual business units, and I'll start\n",
      "with Diagnostics. As you know, we closed the Gen-Probe acquisition on August\n",
      "1, one month into our fourth quarter. The integration is progressing well.\n",
      "Overall, we are encouraged by the progress. We remain confident in the\n",
      "original cost synergies estimate and continue to believe it was conservative.\n",
      "And to remind everyone, we talked about $40 million in the first year and $75\n",
      "million within 3 years. We will continue to monitor our progress very closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we've previously noted, our success will be further enhanced by anticipated\n",
      "revenue synergies. We are working diligently to realize the full potential of\n",
      "these synergies. We've cross-trained the multiple salesforces in the U.S. Our\n",
      "physician and lab sales teams are working under singular leadership with a\n",
      "cohesive strategy for driving market share. We conducted 3 very successful\n",
      "global sales meetings in September and October to better leverage our\n",
      "international infrastructure. Most importantly, our sales teams and customers\n",
      "are excited about the combination of Hologic and Gen-Probe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operationally, many good things have been happening with the Diagnostic\n",
      "business, and we once again experienced strong performance in our legacy\n",
      "business, as well as the addition of Gen-Probe. As you are aware, the PANTHER\n",
      "launched in the U.S. a few months ago. We couldn't be more pleased with its\n",
      "market reception to date. Our worldwide installed base of PANTHER stands at\n",
      "just over 200 units in both Diagnostics and blood screening. We believe that a\n",
      "target of 1,000 PANTHER units installed by the end of '15 is most doable.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is great automation for the middle tier of the lab market, where higher\n",
      "growth is expected in the future. Our strategy of locking up sockets in a\n",
      "different segment of the lab market is already showing signs of traction. We\n",
      "expect roughly 50% of PANTHER placements will be in new mid-tier labs. Every\n",
      "one of these placements is an indicator of future assay revenues as test\n",
      "volumes ramp up and menu expansion occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "APTIMA 2 is a flagship of our STD-testing portfolio, which is now being\n",
      "introduced to an even broader segment of the lab markets for PANTHER\n",
      "placements. We believe we will start to see incremental CT/GC volume on new\n",
      "PANTHER placements by the second half of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the exciting news about PANTHER, we are highly focused on\n",
      "leveraging our 700 unit TIGRIS installed base to promote organic growth in\n",
      "several key product areas, including CT/GC, APTIMA HPV and Trich.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recognized initially there were some question over how 2 HPV products would\n",
      "coexist. Well, our efforts to develop clear selling strategies, positioning\n",
      "both products to meet specific customer needs is paying dividends. I'm\n",
      "encouraged with the flexibility the 2 offerings provide to us by addressing\n",
      "both the centralized and decentralized segments of the lab markets in the U.S.\n",
      "and abroad. And now, we're up at the Genotype Assay available. We have a\n",
      "complete portfolio of HPV offerings, including a full complement of automation\n",

      "\n",
      "**Mogens C. Bay - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everybody and thank you for joining us. Let\n",
      "me begin with third quarter highlights.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, sales were at record third quarter levels, increasing 33% with each\n",
      "segment achieving third quarter sales records. Second, operating income\n",
      "increased 64% and was 12.5% of sales. Third, net earnings increased 43%.\n",
      "Fourth, the company's backlog is at record levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I review the results by segment, I'd like to make a few general\n",
      "comments about the current credit tightness and how it might impact Valmont.\n",
      "We'll start with our Engineered Support Structures segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large part of the North American business consists of highway projects.\n",
      "These projects are funded primarily through the highway bill at the federal\n",
      "level with secondary [ph] funding on the state level. The source of these\n",
      "funds is a combination of state and federal gasoline taxes. While some states\n",
      "may currently face budgetary issues, historically, highway spending continues\n",
      "to be funded because of the crucial need to maintain and upgrade highway\n",
      "infrastructure. Another benefit of highway funding has been to preserve the\n",
      "many jobs that infrastructure construction supports at the local level.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the utility business, utilities have historically had very good credit\n",
      "rating and ready access to credit. They can recover their investments through\n",
      "usage rights. A solid transmission grid is a must to support economic activity\n",
      "worldwide. We expect continued strong levels of utility investment in\n",
      "transmission and distribution infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the irrigation business, in North America, the balance sheets of farmers\n",
      "are generally strong. Land values have increased and the farmer is not highly\n",
      "leveraged. To buy our equipment, most farmers borrow from their local banks or\n",
      "finance company specializing in lending for irrigation equipment. In\n",
      "conversations with ag bankers, they indicate that they would actually rather\n",
      "make loans for irrigation equipment than for other farm machinery because\n",
      "pivots increase productivity and help ensure that other costly inputs such as\n",
      "fertilizer and seed bear fruit. Our international customers also have healthy\n",
      "balance sheets, and for the most part financing for pivots is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our Coatings customers, galvanizing represents a small percent of the\n",
      "final product cost. Our customers value the benefits of corrosion protection.\n",
      "We have a diverse customer base that participates in many industries with a\n",
      "heavy emphasis on infrastructure. It's difficult to determine exactly how\n",
      "tight credit will impact our Coatings customers. We do know that our Coatings\n",
      "business is correlated with the industrial economy and infrastructure, which,\n",
      "at the current time, remain fairly firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other side of the credit issue is the impact on our distribution system\n",
      "and suppliers. In addition to our normal checks and balances, we are closely\n",
      "following developments and, as best as possible, monitoring the financial\n",
      "strength of customers and suppliers. So far, we have not had any agent,\n",
      "dealer, vendor or supplier tell us that they could not conduct business\n",
      "because of tight credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's review the third quarter results by segment. I'll begin with the\n",
      "Engineered Support Structures Segment where sales increased 13% to $187.1\n",
      "million. Operating income increased 2.7% to $16.3 million or 8.7% of sales.\n",
      "The decrease in operating income is the result of costs associated with the\n",
      "start up of a new plant in China, reduced factory performance in a North\n",
      "American plant and increased marketing development expenses for international\n",
      "markets. This was partly offset by the favorable impact of acquisitions and\n",
      "improved North American specialty structures performance. Increased SG&A\n",
      "spending in our international business relates to initiatives to expand into\n",
      "new territories and open new markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "In North America, sales of commercial lighting was slightly lower due to\n",
      "softer activity in the commercial construction markets. Sales of lighting and\n",
      "traffic products for the transportation market increased, particularly sales\n",
      "for projects funded by the U.S. federal highway bill. The current highway bill\n",
      "will expire in September of 2009. Each successive highway bill has been larger\n",
      "than the previous one. In the past, if there is a delay in signing a new bill,\n",
      "funding has been provided by Congress at the expiring bills' run rate. We\n",
      "would expect the same scenario this coming year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In international markets, in addition to higher volumes, positive currency\n",
      "translates and contributed to higher sales in U.S. dollars. Europe saw good\n",
      "improvements, particularly in Northern Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In China, sales were higher despite transportation interruptions during the\n",
      "Olympic games. Our new facility in the Shandong province started production in\n",
      "August. We have a strong and seasoned management team in China and view China\n",
      "as both a challenging and exciting place to do business. It should continue to\n",
      "be a growth market for our company as that country builds out their\n",
      "infrastructure in rapidly growing coastal cities as well as inland.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Utility Support Structures Segment, sales increased 43% to $113 million\n",
      "due to the additional sales from PennSummit and improved pricing. Operating\n",
      "income increased 45% to $14.5 million or 12.9% of sales as a result of the\n",
      "PennSummit acquisition, the recovery of material costs and better factory\n",
      "performance. The North American utility market is strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following decades of limited investment in transmission and distribution\n",
      "infrastructure, utility companies are investing heavily to upgrade the grid.\n",
      "We expect continued investment to improve reliability and support increased\n",
      "transmission of electricity across state borders. In ongoing discussions with\n",
      "utility customers, we hear no indications of a slowdown. We are experiencing\n",
      "good order flow. We have record backlogs at this time and are pursuing\n",
      "numerous very large projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "An additional source of growth for Valmont's utility business is the trend\n",
      "towards more wind power. Each wind farm needs to be connected to the grid\n",
      "through new transmission lines, providing opportunities for us, whether\n",
      "structures of steel, concrete or a combination of both. Valmont offers the\n",
      "broadest lanes of materials to match the needs of our utility customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Irrigation Segment, sales were 77% higher at $150 million in what is\n",
      "traditionally a very slow quarter. Global demand for irrigation equipment and\n",
      "products was high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, summer storms in North America contributed to sales growth\n",
      "through the replacement and repair of damaged machines early in the quarter.\n",
      "International markets were particularly strong in Brazil, the Middle East and\n",
      "Australia. The Irrigation Segment operating income nearly tripled. It\n",
      "increased 185% to $25.2 million and was 17% of sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year our irrigation business has achieved record results. The main\n",
      "drivers have been on the demand side of the equation. As diet improvements,\n",
      "particularly in China and India, drive protein consumption, it increases the\n",
      "demand for feed grains and is supportive of crop prices. The emergence of\n",
      "biofuels creates an additional source of demand. Increased demand leads to\n",
      "investment by growers in mechanized irrigation equipment. The combination of\n",
      "further demand on production agriculture and the scarcity of fresh water\n",
      "worldwide creates excellent growth opportunities for our irrigation business\n",
      "going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Coatings Segment, third quarter sales of $35.9 million was 5% higher\n",
      "than last year. Volume increases reflect good demand from our external as well\n",
      "as internal customers. Operating income rose 52% to $9.3 million or 25.9% of\n",
      "sales as a result of lower costs, higher volumes and manufacturing\n",
      "efficiencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to other financial measures, increased inventories and account\n",
      "receivable largely reflects higher sales and backlogs, inflation's impact on\n",
      "inventory valuation and acquisitions. While we continue to experience the\n",
      "impact of inflation in steel, during the third quarter, steel costs have\n",
      "recently moderated. Accounts receivable terms are consistent with historical\n",
      "levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $10 million and capital\n",
      "expenditures were $13.5 million. For the quarter, cash flows from operations\n",
      "were an inflow of $17.2 million, investing cash flow were an outflow of $41.4\n",
      "million and financing cash flows were an inflow of $28.6 million. For the\n",
      "year, depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $38 million and\n",
      "$40 million and capital spending is estimated at between $55 million and $60\n",
      "million. Our third quarter tax rate was 34% compared to last year's third\n",
      "quarter rate of 22%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our outlook for the balance of the year is positive and we expect a good close\n",
      "to the year. For the year, we expect revenue growth percentages in the mid 20s\n",
      "and now expect operating income as a percent of sales to increase about 1 and\n",
      "1.5 percentage point.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we look at 2009 and beyond, trends in most of Valmont's businesses look\n",
      "favorable worldwide. These are unusual times with unsettled conditions in the\n",
      "financial markets. The current credit crisis worldwide will have some impact\n",
      "on our businesses. Exactly where and when we will see it is difficult to\n",
      "determine at this time. However, when we step back and look at long-term\n",
      "drivers, they are strong. Infrastructure spending will continue to be\n",
      "necessary to support economic growth and agriculture will continue to be faced\n",
      "with increased demand to support population growth worldwide and the need for\n",
      "more food and fuel. Recently, we have seen a decrease in commodity prices so\n",
      "far without a corresponding decrease in input costs, which could negatively\n",
      "impact order flow in the short term.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we believe Valmont is well positioned for 2009 and beyond. We are\n",
      "well diversified along product lines and markets. We also diversified\n",
      "geographically with operations throughout the world. We believe this\n",
      "diversification leaves us well positioned to benefit from global\n",
      "infrastructure development, agriculture's challenge to keep up with global\n",
      "grain demand and pressures to reduce the amount of water that is used in the\n",
      "production of food and fiber.\n",

      "distribution piece of your business. Can you give us a little better feel for\n",
      "the types of orders you're seeing, the types of dialogue you're having and how\n",

      "Let me start with conversations. I have actually this week met with two\n",
      "companies that are involved either on the engineering sides of transmission\n",
      "lines on the construction side. And both companies confirmed our view that the\n",
      "investments in the grids in North America will continue to be very strong. Our\n",
      "backlog is at record high and I would guess that when we enter 2009, I would\n",
      "guess that about half the year will be in the backlog.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.**\n",
      "\n",
      "And my second question relates generally to irrigation and your view going\n",
      "into the selling season in January and February and March. You mentioned\n",
      "obviously some detailed comments regarding input costs not coming down yet.\n",
      "Can you clarify a little bit about what they are? Because things like potash\n",
      "and some other things have come down a fair amount. And at what price levels\n",
      "do you except farmers to be impacted in their orders?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mogens C. Bay - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer**\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, when I talk input cost, I talk input cost like fertilizers,\n",
      "which I don't think farmers have seen come down corresponding to what we've\n",
      "seen in commodity prices at the retail level. I think fuel cost will come down\n",
      "as we've seen prices at the gas pumps come down. And I don't think, if we see\n",
      "a slowdown short-term, it is no different from what we've in the past that\n",
      "there maybe an imbalance and farmers are little concern short-term they may\n",
      "postpone some of their purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would expect that we will maybe see more of a compressed selling season\n",
      "then, because the farmers really don't need their equipment in place until\n",
      "planting next plan. And I think that if we see a slowdown, it has nothing to\n",
      "do with credit which is what we read about in the papers everyday is the main\n",
      "worldwide problem. I think it's just the farmers looking at commodity prices\n",
      "being reduced 20, 30% and just the emotional impact that has on short-term\n",
      "buying decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Just one final question. I know you won't give any formal views about next\n",
      "year till probably February. But I'm also aware you've conducted a pretty\n",
      "extensive internal review of all of your business, looking out over five\n",

      "Let me take a moment to review our major segments. In our Global Markets and\n",
      "Investment Banking third quarter net revenues were negative $3.2 billion and a\n",
      "pre-tax loss for the quarter was $6 billion. However, as we have detailed in\n",
      "Attachment VIII of our press release GMI adjusted revenues were positive $2.5\n",
      "billion for the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "To remind you, adjusted revenues exclude significant items both positive and\n",
      "negative that are less indicative of the underlying performance of our\n",
      "franchise such as the gain on the Bloomberg sale, write downs on legacy\n",
      "exposures and fair value gains on our debt. While adjusted GMI revenues are\n",

      "worst months in the history of the credit markets on top of the typical late\n",
      "summer season slow down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference between adjusted and GAAP revenues in GMI was primarily\n",
      "attributable to five things. First we had $5.7 billion in write downs, our\n",
      "previously announced CDO sale and the related hedge terra. Secondly, we had a\n",
      "$4.3 billion gain from the sale of our Bloomberg stake. Third, we had $3.8\n",
      "billion of losses arriving from severe market dislocations in September\n",
      "including real estate related asset write downs and losses related to certain\n",
      "government sponsored entities and major US broker dealers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, similarly impacted by the severe movements in September we had $2.8\n",
      "billion in net gains due to the living of our credit spreads on our debt.\n",
      "Finally, we had $2.6 billion of net losses arising from completed and planned\n",
      "asset sales across residential and commercial mortgage exposures predominantly\n",
      "for cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the revenues detail by business line, FICC revenues were negative\n",
      "$9.9 billion in the quarter. As strong rates and currencies and solid\n",
      "performance in commodities were more than offset by asset write downs,\n",
      "realized losses from sales and overall weakness across other business areas.\n",
      "FICC recorded significant losses as the result of severe market dislocation in\n",
      "September including unusually high credit spread and the default of a major US\n",
      "broker dealer. A positive fair value adjustment on our debt mitigated the\n",
      "impact of the losses to some extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you turn to Attachment VI in our release I will briefly walk you through\n",
      "our major exposures starting with the US ABS CDOs and related Monoline\n",
      "exposures. As we discussed previously we sold $30.6 billion of gross notional\n",
      "value CDOs to Lonestar and to most of our associated hedges with the Monoline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Largely as a result of this we ended the quarter with next exposures of $1.1\n",
      "billion and if you net out secondary trading positions that number is actually\n",
      "less than $1 billion. The majority of the remaining hedges on this portfolio\n",
      "are with highly rated insurance companies and banks that typically have strong\n",
      "collateral posting requirements. Under a billion dollars of exposure is hedged\n",
      "with MBIA and the carrying value of these hedges is $1.4 billion at the end of\n",
      "the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also have hedges in place of monolines on asset classes away from CDOs\n",
      "primarily corporate CLOs, CMBS and RMBS. The market value deterioration of\n",
      "these asset classes has been modest relative to CDOs. During the quarter our\n",
      "credit valuation adjustment on these exposures was not material and our\n",
      "remaining carrying value was $4.5 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to residential mortgages which are detail in Exhibit VII the vast\n",
      "majority of our exposure continues to be US prime mortgages that we have\n",
      "primarily originated with our high net worth First Republic and GWM clients.\n",
      "These are not the typical prime mortgages you see in the marketplace, they are\n",
      "much higher quality. On average, these clients have FICO scores in excess of\n",
      "750, loan to value ratios are less than 60% and is virtually zero loss\n",
      "history.\n",
      "\n",
      "We did recognize the $123 million loss in prime exposures this quarter but\n",
      "this loss is driven by the sale of six entire prime RMBS trading portfolio in\n",
      "our trading book for approximately $400 million during the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Away from the US prime mortgages and on a pro-forma basis we decreased our\n",
      "other residential real estate exposures by 64% effectively eliminating Alt-H\n",
      "in our book and significantly reducing sub-prime and non-US exposures.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the Commercial Real Estate and Leveraged Finance front, in Leveraged\n",
      "Finance we reduced our exposure by approximately $1.4 billion in the quarter\n",
      "through sales and syndication partially offset by a new commitment made during\n",
      "the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Commercial Real Estate excluding First Republic Bank we reduced our\n",
      "exposures to about $11 billion down 25% from the second quarter on a pro-forma\n",
      "basis primarily due to sales of whole loan conduit exposures in the EMEA\n",
      "region. Net exposures related to First Republic Bank were about $3 billion up\n",
      "10% from the second quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, within our US Banks Investment Securities Portfolio, we recognized\n",
      "net pre-tax write downs of approximately $850 million during the third\n",
      "quarter. At quarter end our total portfolio was down to $15.7 billion. For\n",
      "much of this portfolio we continue to believe the market prices ahead of\n",

      "The under utilization of capacity from our low sales volumes in Europe and\n",

      "increase in our LIFO reserve cost us approximately $1.2 million pre tax in the\n",

      "the U.S. financial markets and around the world. As a result, we are taking\n",
      "immediate actions in three areas; a downsizing of TFC, measures related to our\n",
      "funding needs, and steps to accelerate cost productivity across the\n",
      "enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll start with TFC. First, we'll be exiting our asset based lending and\n",
      "structured capital segments plus several additional product lines through an\n",
      "orderly liquidation over the next two to three years as market conditions\n",
      "allow. These assets represent about $2 billion amounts receivable within TFC,\n",
      "$11.4 billion portfolio and we estimate that these assets can be reduced by\n",
      "about $500 million by the end of 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we are limiting new overall originations in our distribution finance,\n",
      "golf and resort portfolios consistent with maintaining franchise value and our\n",
      "commitment to serving existing credit worthy customers. They should contribute\n",
      "another $1 billion in asset reductions next year. They can... then these two\n",
      "actions should result in over 10% reduction in managed receivables in 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of our decision to downsize we expect to write-off if not all most\n",
      "of the goodwill of TFC. As well as take a restructuring charge of headcount\n",
      "reductions and consolidations in the fourth quarter. Going forward we will\n",
      "continue to carefully evaluate the appropriate range of lending activities in\n",
      "light of the strategic fit and continuing developments in the capital markets\n",

      "current or future financial market scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are talking about TFC let me comment a bit on credit performance. Credit\n",
      "stats continued to soften in the third quarter particularly in September.\n",

      "these recent volatile times we have maintained daily access to funding from\n",
      "the commercial paper market as well as other sources. However, given the\n",

      "Thanks Lewis, good morning everyone. Today, I want to start with a discussion\n",
      "of the factors that pressured TFC in the quarter relative to our guidance. We\n",
      "generated operating profits at TFC of $18 million which was $12 million less\n",
      "than our forecast of about $30 million. The three primary drivers were as\n",
      "follows. First, coming into the quarter spreads between prime and LIBOR rates\n",
      "were already abnormally compressed. As we now know those spreads continue to\n",
      "narrow in fact they're virtually non-existent as we speak. That led to a $5\n",
      "million impairment related to our distribution finance securitization\n",
      "facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, even though we were projecting abnormally high borrowing rates, they\n",
      "went up even further and that cost us about $2 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "And third, as the consumer economy deteriorated, our loan loss provision cost\n",
      "about $5 million more than what we had planned for the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's talk about TFC results going forward. Looking at the fourth quarter,\n",
      "we're assuming the credit performance continues to weaken as well as a\n",
      "continuation of the current dislocation in the relationship among prime, LIBOR\n",
      "and Fed fund rates. On this basis, we're projecting a range of possible\n",
      "outcomes from a pre-tax profit of $5 million to a loss of $20 million,\n",
      "depending on how these two major factors play out. This may seem like a wide\n",
      "range for TFC, but in the current environment forecasting accurately has\n",
      "become much more difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking forward to 2009, the goodwill charge and operating results in the\n",
      "fourth quarter will likely result in a capital contribution to TFC between a\n",
      "$170 million and $200 million in the first quarter of next year to maintain\n",
      "certain requirements specified under our committed credit facilities and\n",
      "support agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that let's continue with our forecast and discussion by examining the\n",
      "factors that are going to affect 2009 at TFC. To facilitate this discussion\n",
      "I'd ask you to please refer to slide12 in our key data schedules that we have\n",
      "put up on the website.\n",
      "\n",
      "This schedule summarizes a few very important points that address the\n",
      "resiliency of asset values in most of our portfolio. Historically, TFC has\n",
      "experienced low charge offs relative to delinquency rates because of high\n",
      "recoveries on defaulted loans. For example, in our distribution finance\n",
      "portfolio recoveries have been high because we have three avenues for\n",
      "recovery. The underlying hard collateral to finished goods inventory, the\n",
      "guarantees of the dealers and the repurchase agreements with manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of aviation finance we've had extraordinary control over\n",
      "recoveries because of our intimate presence in the aviation markets. More over\n",
      "the aviation portfolio currently has a loan-to-value ratio of about 70%. So\n",
      "there is significant collateral cushion from which to recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our golf portfolio high recoveries reflect the significant level of owner\n",
      "equity in the assets typically 25% of our assessed value as well as deep\n",
      "pocket owners plus the intrinsic value in the underlying real estate in the\n",
      "event of a default.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, our resort portfolio has shown steady performance through every cycle\n",
      "over the past 20 years. For the largest portion of this business we have three\n",
      "layers of loss protection. Excess collateral related no approval excess spread\n",
      "and the advance rate being limited to 90% of pool value developer repurchase\n",
      "obligations and finally the underlying real estate itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that as background, please take a look at slide 13. We are rolling out\n",
      "two possible 2009 scenarios which range from TFC breaking even to a loss of\n",
      "$125 million. Neither of these scenarios represents our forecast for next year\n",
      "per se, rather we are presenting this analysis to you as a way to understand\n",
      "how different economic scenarios might impact TFC performance next year. Those\n",
      "scenarios reflect our downsizing plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The breakeven scenario assumes that the charge-off rate goes to 1.5% compared\n",
      "to the current year-to-date rate of 0.81% and our previous peak of 1.25%\n",
      "reached during the 2001 to 2003 period. At these levels reserves would in next\n",
      "year at 2.25%, compared to our current level of about 1.6% and the last peak\n",
      "of 1.77%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the financing side, the breakeven scenario assumes the current\n",
      "prime LIBOR spread improves from where it is now to the August levels of about\n",
      "250 basis points, but still higher than the normal level which has\n",
      "historically been a very consistent 285 basis points.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this scenario also reflects the borrowing spread over LIBOR returning to\n",
      "about a 100 basis points compared to the current average of about 250, but\n",
      "still much higher than our historic norm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, moving to the right side of the chart, you can examine for yourself the\n",
      "assumptions there under the loss scenario and how they compare. We believe,\n",
      "these scenarios are reasonable possibilities, but given the tremendous\n",
      "uncertainty in the economy and financing markets, we're going to be monitoring\n",
      "developments very, very carefully and continuing to react as appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that I want to move now to our normal analysis of what drove our third\n",
      "quarter results on a year-over-year basis. Earnings per share from continuing\n",
      "ops were down $0.03 from a year ago. Volume and mix provided a positive $0.10.\n",
      "Higher pricing of roughly 3.3% added $0.27 a share while inflation of about\n",
      "3.2% cost us $0.22.\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance contributed a positive $0.03, acquisitions a positive $0.02 and\n",
      "miscellaneous items about $0.04. Head-wins from engineering, research,\n",
      "development and depreciation cost $0.08 and Textron Financial was lower by a\n",
      "dime. There were two one-time items that benefited last year's third quarter\n",

      "Revenues at Cessna increased a $150 million due to higher volume and pricing\n",

      "recovery and the lower volume. Revenues and segment profit in the commercial\n",
      "business were up $96 million and $16 million respectively. The increase in\n",

      "\n",
      "We have, as usual, the management team here. Ron O‚ÄôHanley, is in Europe but\n",
      "he‚Äôs dialed in and the sound quality is pretty good so when we get to Q&A I\n",
      "think he should be fine. Our operating performance exceeded expectations. It\n",
      "was driven by the diversity of our six security servicing and asset management\n",
      "businesses plus the impact of market volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frankly, our diversity in our business lines versus some of our peers really\n",
      "helps in times of stress. Our operating earnings were $834 million or $0.72\n",
      "excluding LILO/SILO and support charges and the normal M&I and was actually up\n",
      "7% year-over-year. Underlying revenue growth was 8% year-over-year. We had\n",
      "amazing deposit growth in late September from our security servicing clients\n",
      "around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now have $82 billion in non-interest bearing deposits, up $50 billion this\n",
      "year and clearly that would help NII as well. Market volatility resulted in\n",
      "record levels of foreign exchange and trading revenue based upon client\n",
      "volumes and activity. Credit quality remains strong, non-performing loans\n",
      "actually declined this quarter. Our earnings were impacted by capital support\n",
      "agreements, however, it is highly unlikely we will create new ones going\n",
      "forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security losses were only modestly higher than in Q2. We put SILOs and the\n",
      "LILOs behind us. Operating expenses excluding the support agreements were very\n",
      "well controlled. Our expenses were only up 1% year-over-year and down 5%\n",
      "sequentially generating significant positive operating leverage during the\n",
      "quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should mention too a little bit about the TARP program. We were honored to\n",
      "win that mandate and I expect we were probably the only firm that could\n",
      "delivery everything Treasury needed end-to-end and it‚Äôs a terrific\n",
      "reinforcement of why we actually did our merger. So, at this point I want to\n",
      "focus on the remainder of my comments on our balance sheet, the general\n",
      "environment and our outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, liquidity is extraordinarily strong in our company. Our balance sheet\n",
      "includes $116 billion that is effectively overnight cash. Liquid assets are\n",
      "over 40% of total assets and we had $50 billion of zero risk weighted assets\n",
      "with the Fed. OCI impacted our tangible equity. Frankly, our actual losses in\n",
      "our investment portfolio have been a fraction of the unrealized losses and\n",
      "reflect stratospheric discount rates on the expected cash flows due to the\n",
      "current market distress, dislocation, illiquidity, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let‚Äôs remember that these assets are in portfolios where we have the ability\n",
      "and the intent to hold the securities until maturity and that‚Äôs relevant here.\n",
      "Our capital ratios show we‚Äôre well capitalized. Our Tier-1 was 9.33% which is\n",
      "unchanged from the prior quarter. In fact, with the $3 billion preferred\n",
      "equity from Treasury, our pro forma Tier-1 should be around 12% in the fourth\n",
      "quarter. We don‚Äôt need more capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, these are challenging times. We like our underlying revenue growth,\n",
      "expense control, earnings power, liquidity and our capital position. We‚Äôre\n",
      "responding and adjusting to the environment. I really appreciate the support\n",
      "of our employees around the world and I‚Äôm going to ask Todd to provide more\n",
      "detail now on our financials.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thomas P. Gibbons**\n",
      "\n",
      "As Bob indicated, the diversity of our business has helped us deliver solid\n",
      "underlying growth during a particularly challenging period. Let me take you\n",
      "through the highlights of the quarter and please note that for comparative\n",
      "purposes I will exclude the impact of security losses from fee revenue, I‚Äôll\n",
      "exclude the final settlement on SILOs and LILOs from our net interest revenue\n",
      "and I‚Äôll exclude the charge for support agreements on non-interest expense.\n",
      "However, our earnings per share include the impact of the securities losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fee revenue was strong in security servicing and even more so in foreign\n",
      "exchange and other trading. Fee revenue was negatively impacted by the decline\n",
      "in equity values principally in our asset and wealth management fees. Net\n",
      "interest revenue benefitted from a large inflow of non-interest bearing\n",
      "deposits late in the quarter and I think the ability of our security servicing\n",
      "businesses to attract deposits reflects a very positive view of BK during\n",
      "turbulent market periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also continued to win new business during this quarter. We had $400 billion\n",
      "in asset services wins, record levels of new business in wealth management and\n",
      "clearing and we‚Äôre off to a good start in the fourth quarter as Bob said with\n",
      "Tuesday‚Äôs announcements that the Treasury has chosen our corporate trust and\n",
      "asset servicing business to administer the TARP program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operating expenses remained very well controlled and we continue to benefit\n",
      "from the synergies associated with the merger resulting in excellent levels of\n",
      "operating leverage. We have strong capital ratios and note that the primary\n",
      "regulatory ratios of Tier-1 which focuses on risk weighted assets was 9.33%\n",
      "unchanged from the prior quarter and we expect that to go to 12% given the\n",
      "capital infusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let‚Äôs get in to the numbers. My comments will follow the earnings summary\n",
      "report beginning on page 3. Our continuing earnings per share was $0.72. This\n",
      "excludes the charge for support agreements of $0.37 plus an additional $0.09\n",
      "for the SILO/LILO charges and M&I. That‚Äôs growth of 7% compared to the third\n",
      "quarter of 2007. Our net interest revenue in the third quarter was reduced\n",
      "$112 million by the SILO/LILO charges and our fee revenue was reduced by $162\n",
      "million by the securities write downs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a very difficult environment, our total company revenue increased by 8%.\n",
      "The proportion of non-US revenue increased to 34% from 30% in the third\n",
      "quarter of 2007. Factoring out the support agreements, we kept expense growth\n",
      "relatively flat versus the year ago quarter and it was actually down 5%\n",
      "sequentially. This strong expense control resulted in approximately 700 basis\n",
      "points of positive operating leverage year-over-year and approximately 400\n",
      "basis points sequentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to page 5 of the earnings summary, you can see that assets under\n",
      "management decreased 4% over the year ago and prior quarters despite much\n",
      "deeper declines in the global equity markets and a stronger US dollar. During\n",
      "the third quarter we had $14 billion of positive money market flows and $6\n",
      "billion of negative long term flows. Assets under custody and administration\n",
      "decreased 1% compared to the prior year and 3% sequentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decline reflects lower market values and the impact of a stronger US\n",
      "dollar partially offset by $260 billion in new client conversions. Turning to\n",
      "page 6 of the earnings summaries which details fee growth you can see the\n",
      "security servicing fees were up 6% year-over-year reflecting strength in our\n",
      "volume and volatility sensitive activities. If you adjust for the sale of B\n",
      "and G-trade in the first quarter, fees actually increased 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sequentially, fees were down 2% primarily reflecting normal seasonality and\n",
      "securities lending. Now, let‚Äôs look at the components of securities servicing.\n",
      "Asset servicing had a strong quarter with fees up 12% driven by net new\n",
      "business, good cross sell and organic growth, higher securities lending\n",
      "revenue and the impact of the buyout of the joint venture with ABN Amro which\n",
      "we completed late in the fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Securities lending fees were up $45 million year-over-year primarily\n",
      "reflecting favorable spreads in the short term credit markets. Sequentially\n",
      "asset servicing fees were down 7% due to lower securities lending revenue\n",
      "reflecting normal seasonality and lower market levels which neutralized\n",
      "organic growth. We saw the usual pattern of seasonality until mid September\n",
      "when volatility spiked to record levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Issuer service fees grew 9% year-over-year reflecting the diversity of the\n",
      "revenue stream as we enjoyed the growth in depositary receipts, corporate\n",
      "trust and share owner services. Growth also benefited from increased revenue\n",
      "sharing related to the distribution of Dreyfus Products. Clearing fees\n",
      "decreased 14% over the prior year however, if you adjusted for the same of B\n",
      "and G-trade execution businesses, fees actually increased 6% principally due\n",
      "to strong growth in trading along with continued growth in money market and\n",
      "mutual fund fees and we continue to benefit from the market conditions with\n",
      "new clients migrating to Pershing‚Äôs platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to asset management, despite the US equity market declining 24% and\n",
      "global markets by over 30%, asset and wealth management fees fell only 7%\n",
      "compared to the prior year as we continued to benefit from net new business.\n",
      "Performance fees were $3 million, this is up from a -$3 million in the prior\n",
      "year period and down from $16 million in the second quarter. The sequential\n",
      "decline was primarily due to a lower level of fees generated from certain\n",
      "equity and alternative strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fx and other trading revenue generated extremely strong growth of 62% year-\n",
      "over-year and 25% sequentially. We benefitted from higher levels of currency\n",
      "volatility and client volumes relative to both periods as well as the higher\n",
      "value of our portfolio credit default swaps which we used to hedge certain\n",
      "loan exposures. Investment income was off $5 million compared to the third\n",
      "quarter of ‚Äô07 and $28 million sequentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sequential decrease resulted primarily from the decline in the market\n",
      "value of seed capital investments. Turning to NIR which is detailed on page 7\n",
      "of the earnings summary, net interest revenue increased 22% year-over-year and\n",
      "4% sequentially. The performance compared to the year ago quarter reflects\n",
      "both wider spreads and a higher level of average interest earning assets. I‚Äôd\n",
      "like to point out here that as always, the size of our balance sheet is driven\n",
      "by client deposits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In mid September we saw dramatic increase in non-interest bearing deposits\n",
      "across our securities servicing business. Our net interest margin if you\n",
      "exclude the SILO/LILO charges came in at 227 up 25 basis points from the year\n",
      "ago quarter and up 6 basis points from the second quarter. Turning to page 8\n",
      "you‚Äôll be pleased to see how well we have controlled operating expenses.\n",
      "Excluding M&I costs, the amortization of intangibles and the charges related\n",
      "to the support agreements non-interest expenses were up 1% year-over-year and\n",
      "down 5% sequentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1% year-over-year increase was driven by a 5% decline in total staff\n",
      "expense which reflects the ongoing benefit of merger related expense synergies\n",
      "and lower incentives partially offset by the second quarter merit increase.\n",
      "Expenses were also down due to the impact of the sale of B and G-trade and\n",
      "lower software expense and lower business development expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Offsetting these declines were the impact of the fourth quarter of ‚Äô07\n",
      "acquisition of the remaining 50% of the custody joint venture with ABN Amro,\n",
      "higher professional and legal fees. Net occupancy was also higher by\n",
      "approximately $15 million than our normal run rate and that was due to the\n",
      "impact of a one-time adjustment to level certain leases. There was an\n",
      "additional $24 million associated with the lost tapes and $38 million for\n",
      "operational errors in the third quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "All told, we would expect about $50 million of third quarter expenses should\n",
      "not recur in the fourth quarter. Page 9 of the earnings summary shows the\n",
      "investment securities in our portfolio. We have detailed the asset categories,\n",
      "ratings and fair values for each of the investment categories as well as the\n",
      "other than temporary write downs during the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have always purchased high grade primarily short duration mortgage backed\n",
      "and asset backed securities. Our core asset and mortgage backed securities\n",
      "portfolio continue to remain highly rated with 91% either AAA or AA. We\n",
      "continue to have the ability and intent to hold these securities until the\n",
      "prices recover or until maturity. The unrealized net of tax loss of our total\n",
      "securities for sale portfolio was $2.8 billion at September 30th, an increase\n",
      "of approximately $1 billion compared to the prior quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Bob mentioned, this primarily reflects significantly widening credit\n",
      "spreads. We routinely test our investment securities for other than temporary\n",
      "impairment using realistic assumptions based on independent research. In the\n",
      "third quarter we assumed up to an additional 15% decline in national home\n",
      "prices over the next two years and estimated the impact it would have on the\n",
      "cash flows underlying the individual securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result we recorded an impairment charge and wrote down to current market\n",
      "value certain securities resulting in a $162 million pre-tax loss. Let me\n",
      "review with you the list of securities that are garnering the most attention\n",
      "and that have had the greatest impact on our OCI and impairment charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, ALTA securities, at origination 100% of our ALTA portfolio was rated\n",
      "AAA. It has now migrated to 74% AAA, 10% AA and 16% below that. At origination\n",
      "the portfolio‚Äôs weighted average FICO score was 711 and its weighted average\n",
      "loan-to-value was 74%. Approximately 50% of the portfolio is supported by the\n",
      "much better performing fixed rate collateral. The portfolio‚Äôs weighted average\n",
      "current credit enhancement is over 13%.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that losses on the underlying loans would have to exceed 13% before\n",
      "our principal would be at risk. Second, asset backed CDOs, at September 30th\n",
      "the amortized cost net of charges was $0.11 on the dollar and we had only $38\n",
      "million of asset backed CDOs remaining in the portfolio. Third, subprime\n",
      "mortgage securities, 81% of our assets are rated AA or higher. The weighted\n",
      "average current credit enhancement on these assets was approximately 35% at\n",
      "September 30th.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, we had write downs of $10 million related to securities backed by\n",
      "HELOCs. Here where specific securities deteriorated and there was questionably\n",
      "credit support due to below investment grade ratings of certain bond\n",
      "insurance. The HELOC securities are tested for impairment based on the quality\n",
      "of the underlying security and the condition of the monocline insurer\n",
      "providing credit support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Securities were deemed impaired if we expected they would not be repaid in\n",
      "full without the support of the insurer and the insurer was rated below\n",
      "investment grade. During the third quarter we were pleased to reach an\n",
      "agreement with multiple tax authorities that settled the SILOs and LILOs as\n",
      "well as various federal, state and local audits. The combined impact of the\n",
      "after tax charge for these settlements was about $30 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously disclosed, we provided support to clients invested in certain\n",
      "funds impacted by the Lehman bankruptcy. The support agreements relate to five\n",
      "comingled cash funds used primarily overnight custody cash sweeps, four\n",
      "Dreyfus money market funds and various securities lending clients. These are\n",
      "in addition to support agreements that existed at the time and the total\n",
      "expense associated with these agreements amounted to $708 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also offered support to wealth management and treasury service clients\n",
      "holding auction rate securities. The total cost of which was $18 million. The\n",
      "credit quality of our loan portfolio remains stable. The provision for credit\n",
      "losses was $30 million. That compares to a provision of $25 million in the\n",
      "second quarter. Charge offs were less than the provision at $22 million and\n",
      "non-performing assets actually decreased by $12 million to $269 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effective tax rate for the quarter was a -15.5%. This reflects the\n",
      "absolute level of charges associated with the support agreements, the\n",
      "securities losses and the SILO/LILO settlement as well as the settlement of\n",
      "prior tax audit cycles. Excluding these items as well as M&I expenses, the\n",
      "effective tax rate was 32.4%. We are well capitalized and this will be further\n",
      "enhanced by the $3 billion investment from the Treasury.\n",
      "\n",
      "We mentioned the key regulatory capital ratios Tier-1 being at 9.33% and with\n",
      "$3 billion in new capital we expect that to increase on a pro forma basis to\n",
      "about 12%. As I have already noted, our balance sheet grew significantly in\n",
      "the last half of September and it included $37 billion in deposits that we\n",
      "placed at the Federal Reserve and $11 billion of asset backed commercial paper\n",
      "which was financed with a non-recourse loan with the Federal Reserve Bank of\n",
      "Boston.\n",
      "\n",
      "These assets carry a zero risk weighting and so we have excluded them from our\n",
      "calculation of tangible common equity. On an average balance sheet our TCE for\n",
      "the quarter was 441 and on a spot basis at period end it was 388. Now, let‚Äôs\n",
      "turn to the integration. We remain in excellent shape on all key milestones.\n",
      "Revenue synergies of $175 million have been achieved compared to our full year\n",
      "target of $180 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "We reached $144 million in expense synergies during the quarter which is $13\n",
      "million higher than the second quarter and on track to exceed our cumulative\n",
      "targets for 2008. Note that without these expense synergies our operating\n",
      "leverage it would have been 100 basis points rather than the 700 we achieved\n",
      "year-over-year. Over Labor Day weekend, wealth management successfully\n",
      "completed its client conversion on to the targeted platforms and we continue\n",
      "to exceed our service quality and client retention goals for asset servicing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm going to conclude my remarks by offering a few observations about the\n",
      "fourth quarter. Given the ongoing volatility in the markets, we may continue\n",
      "to see better than historical trend performance in foreign exchange, net\n",
      "interest revenue and securities lending. Weak equity markets will continue to\n",
      "impact asset management and performance fees. We will continue to manage\n",
      "expense growth especially carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect the credit provision to be at similar levels with Q3. The tax rate\n",
      "should be around 31% to 32%. The new capital should cost us about $0.01 to\n",
      "$0.02 in the quarter and we are continuing to focus on delivering our\n",
      "synergies. As market sentiment improves we would expect our balance sheet to\n",
      "come back to more normal historical levels negatively impacting net interest\n",
      "revenue but positively impacting asset and wealth management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we are pleased with our operating performance in a difficult market\n",
      "and our ability to continue to control costs. With that, I‚Äôll turn it back to\n",

      "Year-over-year gross margins for the third quarter improved approximately 140\n",
      "basis points to 47.1% primarily due to the impact of higher gross margin in\n",

      "Our ability to generate free cash flow during these challenging economic times\n",
      "has allowed us to continue to strengthen both our balance sheet and our\n",

      "continue to have on the global economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly we believe it is prudent to accelerate the pace of our\n",

      "in the fourth quarter to fund additional cost reduction and restructuring\n",
      "activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "These activities will likely result in the reduction of over 1,000 positions\n",
      "and the closure of a dozen facilities. We believe these actions which will\n",
      "affect a number of our businesses will better position us in 2009 and beyond.\n",

      "With that as a backdrop we expect adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter to\n",

      "the Tektronix acquisition and before the restructuring charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect our full year 2008 adjusted earnings per share to be $4.29 to $4.37\n",

      "A couple of slides back I mentioned that the light commercial market segment,\n",

      "their 2009 growth forecast for China from over 105 maybe two months ago to\n",

      "Where dose that leave us? Well as I stated at the beginning, as a result of\n",
      "our strong performance in the third quarter and despite the difficult economic\n",
      "environment we are facing in the fourth quarter, we have increased and\n",
      "narrowed our 2008 earnings guidance to between $2.80 and $2.90 per share from\n",
      "our previous estimate of $2.70 to $2.85 per share. However, we face headwinds\n",
      "going forward including lower commercial volumes and higher raw material costs\n",

      "\n",
      "Regarding our longer-term prospects, again, we see lots of moving parts, some\n",
      "things good and some things not. For instance we do see the housing market\n",
      "stabilizing which is very positive. On the other hand we see it bottoming\n",
      "later than we had previously thought. We see a declining commercial market\n",
      "which carries important mix implications. We see a slowing economy in China\n",
      "which will adversely affect unit demand, but a slow down will allow us and the\n",
      "larger economy to catch our breath while helping to cool global commodity\n",
      "inflation. It all adds up to a lot of moving parts, challenges, and\n",
      "opportunities that we intend to provide further insight to when we meet with\n",

      "\n",
      "Reviewing by market, our sales to DIY market decreased 6% compared to last\n",

      "customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our sales to the manufactured housing market decreased 23% for the quarter,\n",

      "\n",
      "Finally our sales to the industrial market increased by 5% for the quarter,\n",
      "primarily due to a 3% increase in unit sales and a 2% increase in average\n",
      "selling prices. Unit sales growth this quarter was a result of acquisitions\n",
      "and continuing to gain market share and add new customers including concrete\n",

      "10.7% from 12.1% last year. And our gross profit dollars decreased by 20.3%.\n",
      "The decline in profitability from last year was primarily due to ongoing\n",

      "Our effective tax rate is almost 44% for the year to date which resulted in\n",
      "tax expense for the quarter despite recording a book loss. This is primarily\n",
      "due to the impact of non-deductible permanent tax differences and the fact\n",
      "that the Federal Research and Development tax credit was not granted\n",

      "Pat has been with Universal for 24 years. He‚Äôs done it all here and he‚Äôs done\n",

      "\n",
      "You saw our numbers, they‚Äôre nothing to be happy about and they‚Äôre nothing\n",

      "worked so hard for and they don‚Äôt move the needle on the growth monitor. But\n",
      "they do give us reasons to be proud of what we‚Äôve been able to do in these\n",

      "\n",
      "As I‚Äôve noted to our employees here, our operations that are devoted solely to\n",
      "the site-build business have cost us over $30 million in losses this year as\n",
      "of September. If you remove our site-build, our performance has been\n",
      "respectable, especially in times like these. And that‚Äôs because we‚Äôre doing\n",
      "the right things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Bill said, we‚Äôre focused on our balance sheet and growing market share\n",

      "\n",
      "I believe that‚Äôs why we started to see improvements in our margins in the last\n",
      "three to four weeks, because we‚Äôre working on cutting costs, on pricing our\n",
      "products right on receivables and inventory. In fact in some instances our\n",
      "field operations have been so intent by maintaining low inventories that they\n",
      "got too lean.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we‚Äôre working with them to get a little bit better balance to make sure\n",
      "that they keep their inventories in lines with their needs. But they‚Äôre also\n",
      "flexible enough to take advantage of any good purchasing opportunities that\n",
      "come their way. We‚Äôre starting to see more and more competitors cut back their\n",
      "operations or close. And that‚Äôs going to get us opportunities for additional\n",
      "business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here‚Äôs a look at our markets. In DIY we‚Äôre focused on margins, we‚Äôre adding\n",
      "new products with existing customers and we are gaining market share. Some of\n",
      "that will happen as players exit the market, some will happen because we have\n",
      "a rare ability to deliver mixed truckloads to fill multiple needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "And some of that share is coming because we offer the best products and\n",
      "services in the market place. And I wish you could have been in Houston and\n",
      "Galveston the morning after the hurricane struck. The night before a dozen or\n",
      "so of Universal employees from places as far away as Atlanta and Missouri,\n",
      "traveled to Houston to be on the ground so they could help as soon as the\n",
      "storm passed. And that‚Äôs what we did. They went to our customers locations\n",
      "they helped them open their doors. Because their employees were too busy\n",
      "taking care of their own families and property.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Universal employees loaded generators, we mopped floors, and we did\n",
      "whatever we could to help them out. And they did it on their own. I didn‚Äôt\n",
      "have to ask them, their managers didn‚Äôt have to tell them they needed to fly\n",
      "into a storm zone. They did it because that‚Äôs what we do. We keep our\n",
      "customers at heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "And by the way when our people arrived in Houston the storm had knocked out\n",
      "the power in most areas and the hotel was damaged and closed. So they slept on\n",
      "floors at the homes of Universal employees, not one night or two, but night\n",
      "after night. And those homes didn‚Äôt have power either. That tells you a little\n",
      "bit about Universal‚Äôs customer service. And also about the camaraderie you‚Äôll\n",
      "find at Universal. It‚Äôs a special thing. And it‚Äôs one of the reasons we‚Äôre\n",
      "surviving in these challenging times with great spirit and determination.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we noted in our press release our sales to big box customers were flat to\n",
      "up in the market. Our overall decline in this market was mostly because of a\n",
      "drop in business where our independent retail customers whose business is\n",
      "mostly tied to housing. In industrial we‚Äôre doing less with existing customer\n",
      "because they‚Äôre manufacturing less. People are putting off the purchase of new\n",
      "lawn mowers or new mattresses, which means we‚Äôre building fewer bed frames and\n",
      "lawnmower crates. So our strategy is to add more customers. More accounts,\n",
      "less sales per account as Doug Honholt, our Vice President of Industrial Sales\n",
      "like to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to add new customers in our core industrial business and in\n",
      "concrete forming, which we got into earlier this year. Concrete forming is\n",
      "what industrial was in 2000, a wide open area with lots of promise. And we‚Äôre\n",
      "seeing solid early promise from national companies looking for a supplier that\n",
      "can meet their needs throughout the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "We‚Äôre supplying construction companies that are working on everything from\n",
      "botanical gardens to highway bridges. We added 110 new concrete forming\n",
      "accounts this year. And we now have 22 account managers going after concrete\n",
      "forming business out of 20 Universal plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "It‚Äôs one way we‚Äôre building our business in the down economy. We‚Äôre also\n",

      "have no presence, markets like Seattle and the Plain States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Site-build there just isn‚Äôt a lot to say. We stay focused on making sure that\n",
      "we‚Äôre right sized to the markets and our opportunities. Sometimes that means\n",
      "closing plants that are losing money. Sometimes you keep an unprofitable plant\n",
      "open because you‚Äôre willing to take a small loss in order to stay in a market\n",
      "or to keep up a particular customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our strategy is different location by location, by location and region, but we\n",
      "continually evaluate and weigh our operations about the short term and long\n",
      "term opportunities. We‚Äôre looking for new opportunities in multi-family and\n",
      "light commercial and in government projects. And we‚Äôre taking business only\n",
      "that has acceptable margin. If the competition wants to cut prices below cost,\n",
      "that‚Äôs their game. It isn‚Äôt ours and we‚Äôre walking way from it, because\n",

      "you take away from this release and this call are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number one as I said earlier our business today can be described as more\n",
      "customers, less sales per customer. In some markets we‚Äôre adding new\n",
      "customers, but customers still aren‚Äôt doing the volume they were doing before\n",
      "the economy crashed. So we have to add more of them, more customers, less\n",
      "sales per customers. Number two, we have a solid balance sheet and a strong\n",

      "to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And number three and most important, Universal‚Äôs people are the best and the\n",
      "most productive workers I can imagine. We‚Äôve had to cut and do more with fewer\n",

      "page 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "We just start off by saying that in times like these, it is good to be a part\n",
      "of the company that makes real products the people around the world need and\n",
      "use everyday. Our third quarter results demonstrate once again that balanced\n",
      "works. Performance was strong across our businesses. We saw margin expansion\n",
      "at five of our six businesses in overall 60 basis points, operating margin\n",
      "expansion, adjusted for restructuring and one-time gains and also saw a\n",
      "double-digit earnings growth at four of our six businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash flow in the quarter was strong; free cash flow at 123% of net income. We\n",

      "Okay, I'll have Akhil take you through all the business unit detail in just a\n",

      "of restructuring charges, ended by strong operating performance and a small\n",

      "\n",

      "quarter of both '07 and '08, earnings per share was up 16%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. Let's go to slide three. Organic growth in the third quarter was 4%.\n",
      "This is impacted, of course, by slower growth at both Pratt & Whitney and\n",
      "Carrier. Pratt & Whitney saw a mid-teens decline on its large commercial\n",
      "spares and a book-to-bill below one.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, Hamilton Sundstrand's commercial spare sales were up in single\n",

      "plenty of good things on the other side of the laser [ph].\n",
      "\n",
      "Number one for UTC is the balance of the business. And we see this with\n",
      "continued good growth expectations in 2009 from our longer cycle businesses\n",
      "like Otis, Sikorsky and the commercial and military OEM aero businesses.\n",
      "Significant aftermarket content at several of our businesses also provides a\n",
      "natural buffer times. And there will be benefits in 2009 from this year's\n",
      "restructuring costs and of course the continued implementation of UTC's ACE\n",
      "disciplines.\n",

      "equipment from the beginning of the year which is still about a year's worth\n",
      "of new equipment orders if you'll look, new equipment revenues. Last time on\n",
      "the commercial market turndown, there was some impact on backlog, we haven't\n",
      "seen that yet in orders. Reset is pattern [ph] in the third quarter but still\n",
      "pretty decently year-to-date at 15% growth. So we continue to watch that\n",

      "\n",
      "**Gregory J. Hayes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer**\n",

      "I guess just to give you some comfort to Otis. Although the orders were flat\n",

      "up more than 30%. In the U.S. obviously, it was down... we knew it was going\n",
      "to be down. It was driven a big piece of that by cancellation of a project in\n",
      "Las Vegas, I think it was the Echelon Hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I wouldn't draw a conclusion from I think one quarter's worth of data.\n",
      "Backlog remains strong. I think Otis is going to have a very good rest of this\n",
      "year and into 2009. We also have not seen vacancy rates increase dramatically\n",
      "around the U.S. although I think we saw some maybe some preliminary\n",
      "indications that they are up a little bit, nothing new what we saw in the last\n",

      "Well, in fact, let me... I've got some numbers on the top of my head here. Lot\n",
      "of the inflation over the last seven years has been part of $1 billion and\n",
      "about $700 million of that has been at Carrier Corporation. So Carrier has\n",
      "seen a disproportionate impact and really that started in 2004 when the copper\n",
      "first moved from $0.80 to $1.20. So if you think about Carrier ex the copper\n",
      "and the other materials inflation, you're thinking about another 200 basis\n",

      "Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. The environment we are facing\n",
      "today is clearly as volatile and as extreme as I have seen. In the space of a\n",
      "few weeks the financial services industry has been completely transformed.\n",
      "Several large investment banks are gone and the pendulum has now swung back to\n",
      "traditional banking as the business model for stability in this industry. I\n",
      "think that was recently confirmed by the extraordinary government intervention\n",
      "and support of the banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a blink of these changes financial companies are being liquidated,\n",
      "consolidated and merged and governments worldwide are taking extraordinary\n",
      "measures to stabilize these economies. In short, every financial services\n",
      "company is meeting its balance sheet and the quality of that balance sheet is\n",
      "determining the future of many companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many consumers have lost confidence and the ramifications are extraordinary.\n",
      "We support the efforts of the Treasury to restore confidence in the financial\n",
      "industry and PNC is currently evaluating the Treasury initiative and as we get\n",
      "full details we will review it with our board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we are seeing renewed respect for the importance of the fundamentals;\n",
      "balance sheet strength, solid capital and liquidity position and a focus on\n",
      "customers. That is where PNC has been all along. We continue to take the long\n",
      "view, investing in products and markets where we see opportunities for growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a time of great uncertainty, PNC we believe has posted solid results,\n",
      "reflecting the performance of our core business activities. Let me go through\n",
      "those core items for you. Our net interest income grew 31% compared to the\n",
      "same period last year. That is very much in line with the full-year guidance\n",
      "we provided. Our Treasury team had our balance sheet well balanced from a\n",
      "credit and interest rate perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on secondly to credit quality. This reflects our moderate risk profile\n",
      "and our third quarter results are well within the parameters we projected last\n",
      "quarter. For example, our third quarter total net charge offs which were\n",
      "marginally above our second quarter results should continue to be among the\n",
      "best in the industry. As you have come to expect, our expenses were well\n",
      "managed in the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we told you in September, we expected market volatility to affect several\n",
      "non-interest items in the quarter. The impact of this volatility affected\n",
      "corporations such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other valuations in our\n",
      "portfolio. On the valuation side we had some valuation changes for our\n",
      "commercial mortgage loans held for sale. These valuation adjustments did not\n",
      "represent credit quality concerns with the underlying assets as the credit\n",
      "quality remains excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blackrock‚Äôs share price was up late quarter increasing the quarterly valuation\n",
      "of our [inaudible] obligations. Reflecting volatility on the corporate side we\n",
      "took some other-than-temporary impairment charges during the quarter primarily\n",
      "related to the ownership of Freddie and Fannie preferred stock but we also had\n",
      "losses in our trading position. Rick will discuss these in more detail in just\n",
      "a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving to our businesses, PNC had 36,000 net new consumer and business\n",
      "checking relationships through organic growth during the third quarter, a 160%\n",
      "increase over the growth in the second quarter reflecting a flight to quality.\n",
      "Virtual Wallet, our banking product designed for Gen Y customers helped drive\n",
      "that account growth. We started marketing this online banking tool in early\n",
      "August and generated 15,000 accounts by the end of September. These are high\n",
      "quality accounts with deposit balances that are nearly 20% higher than we\n",
      "expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retail banking also saw strong growth in consumer loans and transaction\n",
      "deposits compared to the same period a year ago. When we look at our corporate\n",
      "and institutional banking segment we also saw significant growth in the\n",
      "quarter as more large corporate, middle market and municipal customers are\n",
      "turning to us for a banking relationship that includes credit and fee based\n",
      "products and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "While softness in the real estate market remains, we are seeing very good\n",
      "returns on our new customer relationships and spreads are better. We continue\n",
      "to allocate capital based upon risk adjusted return opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our third business, servicing revenue and global investment services was up\n",
      "compared to the same period last year. Despite experiencing outflow of funds\n",
      "due to the dislocation of the global equity markets we saw net new customer\n",
      "growth in the third quarter as a result of our acquisition of Albridge\n",
      "Solutions and Coates Analytics and the pipeline for new customers is strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this very volatile market we are pleased with the performance of our\n",
      "balance sheet from an interest rate and a credit quality point of view. Our\n",
      "expense management remains strong for the quarter and our strategic focus on\n",
      "maintaining moderate risk profile continued to serve us well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Rick will provide you with additional insight into our financial results\n",
      "with particular focus on the quality of our balance sheet. Rick?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Richard Johnson**\n",
      "\n",
      "Good morning everyone. PNC generated solid results in the third quarter\n",
      "particularly considering the current economic environment. Our results were\n",
      "characterized by strong net interest income growth, solid fee income\n",
      "performance, disciplined expense management and manageable credit cost\n",
      "migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as we explained in the 8K we filed in September, our results were\n",
      "also affected by the Blackrock LTIP loss of $51 million, $82 million of\n",
      "valuation adjustments related to market dislocation on commercial mortgage\n",
      "loans and net security losses driven by our $80 million investment in Fannie\n",
      "Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock. In addition, we recorded a $44 million\n",
      "charge of other than temporary impairment losses in the quarter which should\n",
      "have been recorded in the second quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, PNC reported $248 million net income or $0.71 diluted earnings\n",
      "per share for the quarter. While these results are below the quarterly\n",
      "expectations, we still remain comfortable with our full-year guidance. That is\n",
      "my first key message for today.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second message is we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity\n",
      "positions. Third, our moderate risk profile has provided with a differentiated\n",
      "balance sheet resulting in high quality securities portfolio and manageable\n",
      "risk from our credit folks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs take a look at the second key message as capital and liquidity are\n",
      "critical differentiators in these tumultuous times. Our disciplined approach\n",
      "to capital management has resulted in a tier one capital ratio of 8.2%. We\n",
      "intend to continue to work to build capital flexibility to retain earnings\n",
      "growth to provide the support our customers need during this period of\n",
      "uncertainty. However, we are also reviewing the government program and will\n",
      "consider this as another potential source of further capital for strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also take a very proactive approach to liquidity management. We regularly\n",
      "stress test our liquidity forecast for extreme market events beyond the\n",
      "current market environment. For funding contingencies such as our outstanding\n",
      "commitments, our conduit and our VRDN programs. We remain comfortable that our\n",
      "liquidity forecasts are more than adequate under these stress scenarios.\n",
      "Further to my point, government actions continue to provide additional sources\n",
      "to our liquidity position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs turn to slide five and talk about our differentiated balance sheet.\n",
      "In the current environment balance sheet strength is critical to the long-term\n",
      "management of capital and liquidity and PNC‚Äôs balance sheet is strong and well\n",
      "diversified. We have grown non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits.\n",
      "In fact, total deposits grew 8% year-over-year. In addition to acquisitions,\n",
      "much of this growth was the result of a flight to quality and we were not\n",
      "under as much pricing pressure as many of our peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our retail segment we have seen core growth and demand in money market\n",
      "deposits, partially offset by lower CD deposits, reflecting our focus on\n",
      "relationship customers. We also saw loan growth of 14% year-over-year. With\n",
      "less access to the capital markets more companies are looking to banks to meet\n",
      "their needs. We are seeing higher utilization rates by some of our existing\n",
      "commercial customers. Further, we have had opportunities to grow new customers\n",
      "as we have had the products and capital flexibility to respond to\n",
      "opportunities that meet our moderate risk profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs take a look at our securities portfolio. As shown on slide six, our\n",
      "$31 billion securities available for sale portfolio represented 21% of our\n",
      "balance sheet at September 30 and this is a high quality portfolio. First of\n",
      "all, $12 billion of the securities are agency backed. Second, 95% of the non-\n",
      "agency securities are AAA rated with 98% greater than single A, all with\n",
      "relatively high levels of subordination. Third, the remainder of the portfolio\n",
      "is both granular and well diversified.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the net unrealized losses on this portfolio have increased from $2\n",
      "billion to $3.6 billion in the third quarter, this increase was primarily\n",
      "driven by market liquidity factors and was not representative of credit\n",
      "quality concerns on the underlying assets. In addition, the expected weighted\n",
      "average life of these fixed income securities was 4.7 years at quarter end\n",
      "which we believe is one of the shortest in the industry. Clearly we have the\n",
      "liquidity to be patient as the short-dated assets pulled apart and we\n",
      "recapture the market valuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as you would expect we did take some charges during the quarter\n",
      "related to this portfolio the most significant being a $74 million charge\n",
      "related to our ownership of $80 million of Fannie and Freddie preferred stock\n",
      "reported in net security losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now turning to other balance sheet assets, our loans held for sale represents\n",
      "1% of our balance sheet and declined 36% year-over-year. As you know, the\n",
      "securitization market is essentially frozen in the third quarter. Despite the\n",
      "lingering softness, our goal is to continue to reduce our position. In fact we\n",
      "reduced our inventory by approximately $90 million during the quarter due to\n",
      "individual loan sales. However, we did incur $82 million of valuation losses\n",
      "this quarter in this category due to market illiquidity. Overall, this\n",
      "portfolio is comprised of high quality assets and the largest portion of this\n",
      "portfolio is $1.5 billion of commercial mortgage loans with less than $15\n",
      "million of delinquencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other assets of $30 billion includes our investment in Blackrock and other\n",
      "equity investments, trading positions, good will and other intangible assets.\n",
      "We did have some valuation impairments to our equity investments in the\n",
      "quarter the largest of which was the additional other than temporary\n",
      "impairment of $30 million to our investment in GMAC and $23 million of mark-\n",
      "to-market adjustments in our private equity portfolio. In addition, we\n",
      "reported $54 million of trading losses during the quarter driven primarily by\n",
      "significant widening of credit spreads in extremely illiquid markets. As we\n",
      "have been doing all year, we continued and we will continue to reduce our risk\n",
      "in this portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs look at our credit portfolio and our overall charge off and reserve\n",
      "trends. Now, slide seven shows our credit quality metrics on a consolidated\n",
      "basis. Our loans make up only 52% of our balance sheet at quarter end.\n",
      "Relative to our peers we have fewer credit assets overall and the performance\n",
      "of these assets on a relative basis has been better than most. In these\n",
      "challenging markets, deterioration was to be expected. In the third quarter we\n",
      "saw a manageable migration of $142 million in assets to nonperforming status.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see from the recent trends our net charge offs of 66 basis points\n",
      "continue to be relatively stable and should be among the lowest in the\n",
      "industry. The allowance to loans ratio continued to increase to 1.4%\n",
      "representing another form of capital in this challenging period.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the capital side our residential real estate development loans continue to\n",
      "be the concentration of our commercial credit deterioration. These loans are\n",
      "primarily located in Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey. This $1.8\n",
      "billion portfolio represents less than 2% of our total assets. The average\n",
      "size of these outstanding is about $1.4 million per loan. We believe this\n",
      "gives us greater flexibility in dealing with these credits during this\n",
      "difficult market. However, we do expect further growth in nonperforming assets\n",
      "and charge offs in this category for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the consumer side our largest position is in home equity loans. This nearly\n",
      "$15 billion portfolio is comprised of 39% first lien positions and the rest\n",
      "are second lien positions. Both portions are performing well at this stage in\n",
      "the cycle. Nearly all these loans are in our footprint and our strategy did\n",
      "not involve targeting the sub prime market.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the third quarter net charge offs in our home equity portfolio were 58\n",
      "basis points compared to 53 basis points in the second quarter. While I expect\n",
      "this to be significantly below our peers, I do expect this charge off rate to\n",
      "increase modestly in the periods ahead. However, the 90-day delinquency rate\n",
      "of 46 basis points remained flat compared to the second quarter. Overall our\n",
      "credit trends remain manageable and our loan portfolio continued to perform\n",
      "well in this difficult market. We believe our moderate risk profile and the\n",
      "adequacy of our reserves differentiated our balance sheet from our peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead we continue to see our full-year provision to be around $750\n",
      "million with the outcome largely dependent on the strength and weakness of the\n",
      "U.S. economy. I hope you get the sense that our long-term approach to business\n",
      "and our moderate risk profile is delivering a balance sheet for all economies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I‚Äôd like to turn to our diversified quality revenue streams, another\n",
      "reason why we are succeeding in this challenging environment. One of PNC‚Äôs\n",
      "differentiating strengths it the diversity of our revenue streams. For\n",
      "example, we generated 49% of our revenues from non-interest income and over\n",
      "80% of our year-to-date revenue from non-interest income and deposits. As a\n",
      "result and despite the isolated revenue volatility due to the illiquid markets\n",
      "we have seen our year-to-date total revenue grow 9% compared to the same\n",
      "period last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now turning to the drivers of revenue, our liability sensitive balance sheet\n",
      "was well positioned for the rapid decline in short-term rates that took place\n",
      "earlier in the year and reduced our overall cost of funds resulting in strong\n",
      "net interest income growth of 31% compared to the same quarter last year. Net\n",
      "interest income also increased 2% on a linked quarter basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at our non-interest income, two revenue streams you would expect to be\n",
      "affected most by current market volatility were fund servicing and asset\n",
      "management. Despite these challenges, fund servicing revenue was essentially\n",
      "flat late quarter and grew 12% compared to the same period last year driven\n",
      "primarily by growth from existing global investment servicing clients and new\n",
      "business from our emerging products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our asset management revenues were down linked quarter and year-over-year due\n",
      "to lower asset values in the broader markets. Nevertheless we continue to have\n",
      "strong sales in our wealth management business and tremendous amount of\n",
      "referrals through our branch distribution network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly asset valuation and outflows will put pressure on these revenue\n",
      "streams. However, our focus remains on deepening client relationships and\n",
      "developing products to create long-term value. Together, consumer service fees\n",
      "and service charges on deposits were up 4% from the linked quarter primarily\n",
      "due to increased debit card usage as the result of higher activation levels\n",
      "and the acceptance of our products and services in new markets. Year-over-year\n",
      "revenues were down due to the impact of the Hilliard Lyons sale. Corporate\n",
      "service revenue increased 7% linked quarter primarily due to higher merger and\n",
      "acquisition advisory fees offset by lower capital market revenues from fixed\n",
      "income derivatives and loan syndications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our other non-interest income was affected by losses mentioned earlier.\n",
      "Approximately $285 million due to the Blackrock LTIP shares adjustment,\n",
      "commercial mortgage loans held for sale, valuation net security losses and\n",
      "trading and equity management losses, partially offset by a $61 million\n",
      "reversal of a legal contingency reserve that resulted from settlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall we are pleased with the growth of our fee based businesses and we see\n",
      "opportunities for further growth for our investments in new products and\n",
      "markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "On slide nine you can see we created positive operating leverage on a year-to-\n",
      "date basis with a 9% growth in revenue and a 7% increase in expenses primarily\n",
      "driven by investing in new products and new markets including acquisitions.\n",
      "Based on our economic assumptions as we look to the full year we expect full-\n",
      "year total revenue growth to exceed 10% on a year-over-year basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "We still expect non-interest expense growth will remain in the low to mid\n",
      "single digits resulting in significant positive operating leverage, more than\n",
      "enough to cover the increased cost of credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 32% for the full\n",
      "year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now all in all we believe our business model, which focuses on the long-term,\n",
      "continues to serve us well. Our full-year guidance has not changed. Our\n",
      "capital liquidity positions are strong. Our balance sheet is well positioned\n",
      "and credit quality migration continues to be manageable reflecting our\n",
      "moderate risk profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe this strategic focus positions us to deliver a very solid year.\n",

      "**James Rohr**\n",

      "We believe this was a good quarter for PNC during an extremely volatile time\n",
      "for the financial services industry and I am particularly pleased with the\n",
      "results of our core business activities. We posted strong net interest income\n",
      "growth. Our asset quality remained manageable in a very challenging market.\n",
      "Our capital and liquidity position remains strong and many of our fee\n",
      "businesses did well, growing clients and revenues. Clearly market volatility\n",
      "affected some of our fair value assets.\n",

      "discussion of each of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The engine segment had net sales of $259 million before eliminations, an\n",
      "increase of $15 million or 24% between years. Effectively the entire increase\n",
      "was driven by a 27% increase in engine unit volume. Smaller displacement\n",

      "increase. Retail sales of lawn and garden equipment were recently good during\n",
      "the first quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the former months continuing retail demand resulted in better engine\n",
      "reorders, because retailers and OEMs had again attempted to minimize their\n",
      "inventories after the spring selling season. Consequently they needed to meet\n",
      "demands for reordering production. However, at this time we are not increasing\n",
      "our 2009 engine shipment forecast for this activity, because while we are\n",
      "reasonably confident of our placement with the OEMs and major retailers for\n",
      "the spring in 2009, the current economic conditions indicate the spring lawn\n",
      "and garden season maybe challenging. I will discuss this more fully when we\n",
      "get to our outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "First quarter engine shipments also were impacted by the landfall of the\n",
      "number of hurricanes in the United States for the first time in three years.\n",
      "In addition, the heavy demand for snow equipment last winter depleted\n",
      "inventories giving better preseason and early season snow engine orders than\n",
      "we saw last year. The impact of these events was enhanced by improvements in\n",
      "market placement for both our engines and the related products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Major contributor to the first quarter‚Äôs improvement in the engine segment\n",
      "income from operations was the impact of the increased shipment volume. Next\n",
      "largest benefit in the first quarter was the fact that the Rolla Missouri\n",
      "Engine Plant was in the process of being closed down in the first quarter last\n",
      "year; in this year none of those costs existed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally on a smaller scale, slightly increased production levels and some\n",
      "pricing improvement provided some gains in income from operations. All of\n",
      "these favorable factors in the first quarter were partially offset by a mix of\n",
      "product that favored engines to have smaller margins as well as increased\n",
      "manufacturing expenses that reflect higher cost for our major raw materials\n",
      "and other costs such as transportation that are affected by higher oil prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me turn to the power product segment. First quarter net sales at $256\n",
      "million were up $68 million between years. Our net share this morning is the\n",
      "exact opposite of that a year ago when we indicated that the lack of landed\n",
      "hurricane activity had significantly reduced interests in the portable\n",
      "generator category and the lack of activity would be a cycle that would be\n",
      "just forced to wait out.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first quarter of this year the majority of the sales increase in this\n",
      "segment was due to increased shipments in portable generators to address\n",
      "demand from landed hurricanes. Our shipments were aided by a continued strong\n",
      "placement of our products at key retailers. These retailers value our\n",
      "domestically based production from both engines and portable generators that\n",
      "allows us to work with them and react in a timely manner to the intense spikes\n",
      "in sales activity that comes from the significant concentration of storm\n",
      "related demand in a very short period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Net sales for this segment also increased $14 million between years because of\n",
      "our acquisition of the Australian manufacturer of lawn and garden equipment,\n",
      "Victa Lawncare. We are pleased with this acquisition because they have a\n",
      "significant presence in the Australian and New Zealand markets that provides\n",
      "us with good access to those markets and gives us counter seasonal sales to\n",
      "our North American lawn and garden business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dealer sales were similar between years and their inventories continue at\n",
      "normal levels which leads us to believe they could do well next spring\n",
      "depending on the economy. First quarter income from operations for the power\n",
      "products segment was $3 million or $13 million between years from our first\n",
      "quarter loss last year, up $13 million from our first quarter loss last year.\n",
      "The generated product line drove the majority of the income from operations\n",
      "improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sales and production volume provided close to half of the increase. The\n",
      "shipped status by the immediate demand created by the hurricanes and had to\n",
      "ramp up our operating facilities to keep up with demand and rebuild storm\n",
      "stacks in the event of follow-on weather activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approximately $2 million of the income from operations improvement can be\n",
      "attributed to lower selling, engineering and administrative expenses and the\n",
      "lack of startup and rearrangement costs associated with new operations that\n",
      "were incurred in the first quarter of last year, but were not in the current.\n",
      "That concludes what I wanted to say about the first quarter results of the\n",
      "segments. Now let me address some projections for fiscal 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "We‚Äôve broadened the range of our forecast for the year by increasing the top\n",
      "end of our projected range and lowering the bottom end. The upside reflects\n",
      "the benefit that resulted from the increased portable generators sales caused\n",

      "volume.\n",

      "I now anticipate that we could benefit from improved placement of engines and\n",
      "end products with quantities that are projected to be greater than last year\n",
      "and the positive impact this would have on margins from both the sales and\n",
      "production volume prospective. We also believe our price increases will help\n",
      "offset higher [Inaudible] cost experience over the past year and in fiscal\n",
      "2009 in both segments. In addition we are encouraged by the phase of our cost\n",
      "reduction initiatives in all segments of our business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boring the bottom end of our forecast reflects our concern from the improved\n",
      "generator volume and cost reductions that could be offset by another year of\n",
      "market decline in lawn and garden equipment. Current global financial crisis\n",
      "leaves significant doubt as to what market conditions would be like next\n",
      "spring. Since actions of both consumers and major retailers could drive the\n",

      "his thoughts on the performance of our commercial finance business units, and\n",
      "Joe will review our liquidity position and consolidated financial results.\n",
      "Then we‚Äôll be very happy to take your questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we can all agree these are unprecedented times, challenging for you\n",
      "and challenging for us. But here are some key points to keep in mind about\n",
      "CIT. We remain very liquid with a plan to meet at least 12 months of\n",
      "obligations without access to the unsecured bond markets. Our balance sheet is\n",
      "strong. Our tangible capital to managed asset ratio improved 9.2% this quarter\n",
      "and it‚Äôs almost 11% if you exclude our $12 billion of US government guaranteed\n",
      "student loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the quarter we increased our reserves for credit losses by $75 million\n",
      "as the economy has clearly deteriorated, and we continue to work hard to\n",
      "maintain our core commercial franchises - corporate finance, vendor finance,\n",
      "trade and transportation finance - so that they are poised to fill the\n",
      "competitive void and grow earnings when conditions improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the key to viability and success in this environment is to be\n",
      "proactive and decisive, and I believe we‚Äôve demonstrated both of those traits\n",
      "over the past several months. We raised capital when we saw the window in\n",
      "April. We sold assets late last year and throughout this year, including our\n",
      "entire subprime mortgage portfolio in order to shrink the balance sheet and\n",
      "control risks. We entered into a long-term funding relationship with Goldman\n",
      "Sachs and are in the process of finalizing another such relationship with\n",
      "Wells Fargo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our critical priorities in operating the company have been clear: Liquidity,\n",
      "balance sheet management and credit underwriting. These priorities begin at\n",
      "top and are known throughout CIT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with liquidity, I‚Äôm extremely pleased with the progress we‚Äôve made\n",
      "both in renewing existing facilities and raising new liquidity. We have\n",
      "generated over $11 billion of incremental liquidity since we drew the bank\n",
      "line in March. In August we prepaid the $2.1 billion of bank borrowings that\n",
      "were due this month and we have also bought back $250 million of our short-\n",
      "dated debt at a discount. We successfully renewed $6 billion of secured\n",
      "facility that were due to expire in the third quarter, which helped finance\n",
      "both our vendor finance business and our liquidating student loan portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "These actions combined with other funding initiatives led us to retain our\n",
      "rail leasing unit, a great business that we had considered selling solely to\n",
      "generate liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We‚Äôve also been working hard to manage the balance sheet. In fact even with\n",
      "some seasonal growth in trade finance, managed assets declined $0.5 billion\n",
      "this quarter. We have delevered the balance sheet as a result of the capital\n",
      "raise and we will continue to pay off maturing debt and to buy back bonds at a\n",
      "discount. In short, we have been managing for cash as we strive to find the\n",
      "right balance between serving our clients and preserving our franchise while\n",
      "enhancing liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have required each business to identify and execute a funding plan that\n",
      "does not rely upon the capital markets. Nearly half of corporate finance‚Äôs new\n",
      "loans were originated through CIT Bank this quarter. Transportation finance is\n",
      "using the ECA facility for financing all new deliveries through 2009. Both\n",
      "vendor and trade finance are self-financing their new volume through cash flow\n",
      "from operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as a result of the events of the past few weeks we are more actively\n",
      "managing new business originations with tightened underwriting standards and\n",
      "an emphasis on generating liquidity while continuing to service the needs of\n",
      "our most important clients. Specifically new business volume was down $1\n",
      "billion from the second quarter from $4.9 billion to $3.9 billion. Looking\n",
      "forward we anticipate continuing declines in origination volumes as\n",
      "competitors pull back and industry consolidation shrinks the number of\n",
      "providers. Now clearly if the government programs work and liquidity returns\n",
      "to these markets, we will re-examine this approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our third priority has been credit. When I last spoke to you at the Lehman\n",
      "conference about six weeks ago, I provided our credit loss expectations based\n",
      "on the world as we saw it then and expectations were for a slow no-growth\n",
      "sputtering economy. Clearly the world has changed meaningfully over the past\n",
      "few weeks and our outlook has darkened. As you‚Äôve seen, our credit metrics\n",
      "this quarter were mixed: Improvement in delinquencies, a modest increase in\n",
      "nonperformers and a meaningfully higher level of charge-offs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total charge-offs exceeded our expectations largely due to a few discreet\n",
      "items: A commercial real estate loan on which we foreclosed, a bankrupt\n",
      "retailer and a reassessment of a previously-acquired portfolio in vendor\n",
      "finance. As we review the portfolio in light of the current and now\n",

      "and how to make deposits a more significant component of our future mix. We\n",
      "continue to make good progress with CIT Bank both raising deposits and\n",
      "underwriting new loans. CIT Bank originated over $600 million of new loans\n",
      "during the third quarter and we began raising term deposits again in August.\n",
      "About $800 million have been issued so far with average maturities of well\n",
      "over a year at an average cost of under 4%.\n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize however that our Utah bank is not sufficient to achieve our long-\n",
      "term goals. As I indicated in September we are exploring a variety of options\n",
      "that would allow us to expand our deposit-taking capabilities, particularly in\n",
      "light of the government‚Äôs actions over the last several weeks and the last\n",
      "several days.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact anything that improves liquidity in the system and the functioning of\n",
      "the capital markets is good for CIT. So we expect to see ancillary benefits\n",
      "from these recent actions. In addition we are currently reviewing how the CIT\n",
      "Bank as an FDIC-insured institution can directly benefit from the recently\n",
      "announced programs. More to come on all fronts on this topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is disappointing to me that despite all the hard work of our people we were\n",
      "unable to report a profit this quarter as our core commercial earnings were\n",
      "largely erased by an accounting charge, goodwill impairment on vendor, losses\n",
      "in our liquidating consumer business, higher funding costs for government-\n",
      "guaranteed student loans and credit costs for the private loan book.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Alex will describe in more detail, we had continued good performance in\n",
      "trade finance and transportation finance. Corporate finance while profitable\n",
      "experienced both higher credit costs and a decline in fees. As we‚Äôve stated\n",
      "vendor finance continues to underperform as we restructure that business.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I look back at the third quarter, the past three months, I am proud of\n",
      "how much the team here has accomplished. We sold home lending. We successfully\n",
      "completed numerous financings. We began the restructuring of vendor finance.\n",
      "We made significant progress on expense initiatives and headcount reduction.\n",
      "Against this backdrop we kept our customers front and center, our employees\n",
      "engaged and our eye on preserving franchise value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I want to turn it over to Alex.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Alexander T. Mason**\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôve been in finance and banking my entire career and it won‚Äôt surprise you\n",
      "that this is the most substantial financial market crisis I have seen. The\n",
      "credit markets are seized up, employment continues to rise and the economy is\n",
      "clearly in a recession, the extent at which no one at this point can\n",
      "accurately predict.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact on our business has been noticeable. What I would like to do is\n",
      "provide an update on each of our commercial franchises against this\n",
      "increasingly challenging market backdrop. Let me say upfront that on the whole\n",
      "our commercial business has shown tremendous resiliency in a tough\n",
      "environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have two businesses as Jeff said that continued to excel this quarter:\n",
      "Transportation and trade finance; one business, corporate finance, that\n",
      "performed admirably despite being severely hampered by market conditions; and\n",
      "a fourth business in vendor where we have set in motion an aggressive action\n",
      "plan to return this valuable franchise to appropriate levels of profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let‚Äôs start with vendor as turning this franchise around is at the top of my\n",
      "priorities. Since my arrival three months ago I have spent quite a bit of my\n",
      "time meeting with business leaders and conducting a thorough review of this\n",
      "segment. My immediate impression is that this is a valuable franchise and it\n",
      "benefits from great relationships with some of the leading global companies\n",
      "around the world. However we obviously have challenges to overcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our plan to improve vendor finance is multi-faceted and will occur in phases.\n",
      "The first phase, which I just described, is completed and we believe we have\n",
      "identified the primary reasons why vendor is underperforming. The next phase\n",
      "involves acting decisively and aggressively in tackling our challenges and\n",
      "I‚Äôll expand on our action plan in a minute. The final phase is to restore the\n",
      "acceptable returns that this business has historically generated. So let‚Äôs get\n",
      "into specifics.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the organizational structure of vendor was not conducive to taking\n",
      "quick and decisive action. During the quarter we reorganized the segment\n",
      "moving from co-heads to one global head while significantly streamlining the\n",
      "reporting structure. This better aligns us with our vendor partners‚Äô coverage\n",
      "models while at the same time improving the decision-making cycle time and\n",
      "importantly management accountability. These changes will enable us to quickly\n",
      "respond to customer opportunities and needs and market shifts around the\n",
      "globe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we have implemented a cost reduction program across the segment to\n",
      "right size the business and set it up for enhanced profitability in 2009 even\n",
      "if the current market environment extends into next year. In total we should\n",
      "realize almost $40 million of annualized savings as we move forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next we have re-prioritized use of capital to make it available strictly to\n",
      "strategic customers where we provide high value-added service. Simultaneously\n",
      "we are continuing efforts to improve pricing. Where it involves revisiting\n",
      "established pricing arrangements with our large long-standing vendor\n",
      "relationships, this may take a little bit of time. In instances where we use\n",
      "rate cards or price on a deal-by-deal basis, we are able to move more quickly\n",
      "to effect pricing changes. In all cases we are acting aggressively to get our\n",
      "pricing structure to more accurately reflect the changing market conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me be clear. We are focused on risk adjusted return on capital and thus we\n",
      "are willing to forego originations if our desired pricing is not there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, the traditional business model which relied on an integrated capital\n",
      "market strategy including the use of securitizations has obviously been\n",
      "severely hampered. As we go forward we are not relying on off-balance sheet\n",
      "securitizations and we are exploring alternative financing options in\n",
      "virtually every geography to replace that component of our funding strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally given the continued global economic pressures and tight liquidity\n",
      "markets, during the quarter we aligned our approach with respect to\n",
      "remediating and collecting on certain acquired accounts with our core\n",
      "portfolio operating practices. This resulted in charging off $13 million of\n",
      "receivables in the quarter. We continue to evaluate the portfolio for similar\n",
      "actions but would expect any further charge-offs in Q4 to be of significantly\n",
      "lesser magnitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, as has already been noted, we evaluated and subsequently wrote off\n",
      "the entire goodwill and the majority of our intangibles allocated to this\n",
      "segment. Joe will expand on that in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collectively these assertive actions are designed to bring vendor‚Äôs\n",
      "profitability back to appropriate levels for 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next let me move to the corporate finance segment which has seen significant\n",
      "impact from the difficult market conditions. Secondary market pricing has been\n",
      "under extreme pressure of late as loans are being sold often indiscriminately\n",
      "to raise liquidity. Meanwhile the syndication market is virtually nonexistent\n",
      "as the low prices in the secondary market are making the relative value of\n",
      "doing a new transaction with potential lenders that much more difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combined effect has produced major diminution of revenue from both those\n",
      "channels which have traditionally been strong contributors to non-spread\n",
      "revenue. For reference, last year in Q3 revenue from sales and syndication\n",
      "activity totaled nearly $30 million and the year prior was almost $90 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please understand that opportunities to originate new loans at attractive\n",
      "prices with strong covenant packages are plenty but due to size most deals\n",
      "require more than one lender to show up at closing. As the market has\n",
      "tightened, many middle market participants are scaling back origination volume\n",
      "to preserve liquidity and the syndicates or clubs are simply harder to form.\n",
      "In the instances where we are originating, we are partnering with other high-\n",
      "quality lenders to provide strategic capital to our very best clients with a\n",
      "concerted effort to originate through CIT Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed in the third quarter, over 40% of our corporate finance volume was\n",
      "originated through the CIT Bank. In Q4 I would expect overall new business\n",
      "levels to come down and originations through CIT Bank to increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the credit side we saw losses increase by 30 basis points with roughly 23\n",
      "basis points of the impact coming from one commercial real estate account that\n",
      "was foreclosed in the quarter. While we have still yet to see any sustained or\n",
      "systemic losses in any given sub-segment, we expect credit trends will likely\n",
      "continue to be pressured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next let me focus on trade finance which remains a steady performer generating\n",
      "a 14% ROE this quarter. Volumes were up mostly due to seasonal factors which\n",
      "in turn drove higher commissions. As expected credit costs rose to 180 basis\n",
      "points as the retail sector continues to soften. Most of the losses this past\n",
      "quarter relate to one large bankrupt retailer. Most noteworthy however is the\n",
      "excellent job our credit team has done dodging so many of the recent stream of\n",
      "retail failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must tell you that since my arrival I have been tremendously impressed with\n",
      "the ability of this management team to anticipate problems and to manage\n",
      "exposures accordingly. Under normal circumstances we would be significantly\n",
      "ramping up volumes on our ability to charge higher commissions at this point\n",
      "in the credit cycle. But we are in anything but normal times. So going\n",
      "forward, expect us to scale back factoring volumes as we manage risks\n",
      "aggressively by not taking on certain retail accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, on to transportation finance. Utilization for both air and rail\n",
      "remain solid, and the segment as a whole returned 16%.\n",
      "\n",
      "In rail, utilization remained high at 96%. Rail generally benefits from higher\n",
      "fuel prices compared to trucking given its efficiency. However, we saw the\n",
      "higher demand in Q3 being offset by overall reduction in freight\n",
      "transportation as a result of the softening economy. We will continue to\n",
      "monitor this dynamic as we move forward but in general we believe that our\n",
      "best-in-class management team along with our young efficient and diverse fleet\n",
      "positions us well to weather a prolonged or significant downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "In air, demand for more fuel-efficient types of aircraft remains strong in the\n",
      "face of increasing fuel prices. At the same time the wave of recent\n",
      "bankruptcies is causing a dampening effect on lease rates. From a credit\n",
      "perspective we have side stepped most of these airlines, and where we did have\n",
      "exposure we moved quickly to redeploy those aircraft elsewhere. All-in-all air\n",
      "remains almost fully utilized and 19 of the 21 planes being delivered through\n",
      "2009 have been placed, while two of the planes that were scheduled to be\n",
      "delivered to a bankrupt carrier are very close to being redeployed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we move on, let me say that our commercial franchises continue to have\n",
      "tremendous value. However we are in unprecedented times and we will have to\n",
      "make some tough decisions. The common theme you may have picked up from my\n",
      "remarks is that liquidity is currently our number one priority or job one as I\n",
      "have described it before.\n",
      "\n",
      "To that end we will continue to spend considerable time reviewing all facets\n",
      "of our commercial businesses and will be very strategic around where and when\n",
      "to use capital with the likelihood that we will effectively pause or exit\n",
      "certain businesses and product offerings that seem unlikely to provide\n",
      "adequate returns during this period in the economic cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that I will turn the call over to Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Joseph M. Leone**\n",
      "\n",
      "We appreciate you spending some time with us on this call this morning.\n",
      "Clearly the market‚Äôs distressed. I don‚Äôt have to tell you that. While our\n",
      "securities and our core profit drivers have been pressured, our focus has been\n",
      "keen on liquidity, continued client service and our business model\n",
      "transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company overall and my finance team specifically are working on the\n",
      "imperative that maximizing liquidity is priority one. I‚Äôm proud of what we‚Äôve\n",
      "accomplished. The third quarter was very busy with additional successes.\n",
      "Hopefully you find the frequent liquidity updates we have been providing you\n",
      "useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeff highlighted many of the major accomplishments this quarter on liquidity.\n",
      "Let me add some color.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Goldman facility. We started funding under the facility as planned\n",
      "in Q3 and have received or drawn about $1.3 billion of the $3 billion of the\n",
      "committed facility. Fundings to date have been backed by corporate finance\n",
      "assets, essentially middle market loans, from our existing portfolio. Clearly\n",
      "we want to utilize the entire facility by year end, and since many of you know\n",
      "draws under the facility are priced at LIBOR flat and we pay the 285 basis\n",
      "point commitment fee whether we use the facility or not, our current thinking\n",
      "is to fund a combination of corporate, vendor and transportation finance\n",
      "assets through the facility in the fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wells Fargo facility we‚Äôre working on is a five-year $500 million secured\n",
      "facility that we will use to fund middle market loans. The loans can either be\n",
      "from our current portfolio or new originations. We still need to complete the\n",
      "documentation, Wells is going through due diligence, and we need to get\n",
      "through certain closing conditions, and we want to start this funding as I\n",
      "said in the fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to aircraft, we have been funding new aircraft deliveries through\n",
      "secured facilities; Jeff mentioned that; about $400 million to date and we\n",
      "expect to continue to finance new aircraft deliveries next year in the same\n",
      "fashion as the 2009 delivery package we have are Airbus aircraft. Funding\n",
      "under these facilities is long term, about 12 years, at relatively attractive\n",
      "pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sold $400 million of aircraft in the quarter and that brought our sales to\n",
      "over $1 billion. That was the goal we had set in the beginning of the year.\n",
      "We‚Äôd like to continue to make some sales into the fourth quarter. Third\n",
      "quarter gains however were muted somewhat as we had a high oil cost in the\n",
      "summer months, if you can remember that. I do. There have been threats of\n",
      "additional supply but as Alex mentioned the demand for our fleet with all\n",
      "planes flying is very solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deposits. We all spent some part of our remarks on and it‚Äôs been a big focus\n",
      "of ours and yours. As Jeff mentioned, we raised $800 million in the quarter\n",
      "and I want to remind you we did not start posting rates until mid-August as\n",
      "the bank had a lot of excess cash, over $1 billion in July. The total deposits\n",
      "in the bank grew this quarter and the vast majority of that is time deposits.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have gotten questions about the stickiness of the deposits, and I‚Äôll tell\n",
      "you that based upon the deposit agreements which restrict withdrawals to\n",
      "certain conditions, we only had about $1 million of early redemptions so far\n",
      "in 2008. Looking forward we would like to grow the bank deposits by about $500\n",
      "million per quarter as we finance commercial loans to middle market customers\n",
      "in that institution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our secured conduit facilities, Jeff mentioned we renewed. We had $6 billion\n",
      "of conduits expiring in the third quarter and we were successful in\n",
      "refinancing the facilities which fund both student loans and equipment loans.\n",
      "General terms including pricing and advance rates reflect the current market.\n",
      "That‚Äôs code for they were more expensive. We do have another $2.8 billion of\n",
      "facilities expiring in the fourth quarter and these facilities mainly finance\n",
      "trade finance, receivables and equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our current thinking on this is to work and refinance the trade finance\n",
      "facility, and we have begun preliminary discussions on that. We are evaluating\n",
      "the need on the equipment conduit given our recent renewal success and our\n",
      "plan for reduced originations in that segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We did manage the balance sheet down with managed assets down $500 million in\n",
      "the quarter despite our growth in factoring, which is seasonal. We usually get\n",
      "those pay-downs in December and January during the holiday season. In addition\n",
      "to the aircraft sales which I mentioned were $400 million, we sold $200\n",
      "million of middle market loans and volumes decreased $1 billion sequentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very topical. Credit commitment. At September 30 when we report our Q, you\n",
      "will see we have about $8.5 billion of total unfunded commitments. About $1\n",
      "billion of that relates to vendor finance, which are consumer oriented and\n",
      "require an asset to be purchased in order to access the line. Of the remaining\n",
      "$7.5 billion or so we estimate roughly $2+ billion cannot be drawn for reasons\n",
      "that relate to the contract and for collateral shortfall reasons. So the net\n",
      "at-risk figure is closer to $5.5 billion. Of that $5.5 billion about half is\n",
      "asset or equipment based and the balance is cash flow, about $2.7 billion of\n",
      "that is cash flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are we doing about these commitments? First, we have been monitoring\n",
      "commitment and draw activity closely. That should not be a surprise. We have\n",
      "seen a pick up but it‚Äôs been slight in utilization. Our overall utilization is\n",
      "about 75%. We have not seen a large amount of unusual draws but we have seen\n",
      "some activity. That said our liquidity forecast does assume further increases\n",
      "in line utilization based upon our account-by-account analysis of the\n",
      "probability of draw, which we continue to refine every day based on market\n",
      "conditions and our experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash including what we had in Utah bank decreased from $7.4 billion to $5.5\n",
      "billion. Remember we paid down the bank lines early and we paid down about\n",
      "$1.5 billion of unsecured debt and had about $1 billion of outflows related to\n",
      "securitization. Some of that relates to higher advance rates on the new\n",
      "facilities and some of that relates to cash we will get back in the fourth\n",
      "quarter. The inflows relate to home lending, $1.5 billion, and Goldman about\n",
      "$1.3 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "That should give you the picture of how the quarter in liquidity sized up. How\n",
      "about looking forward? I know that‚Äôs on your mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "We estimate needs of roughly $13 billion to meet our maturing obligations over\n",
      "the next 12 months. That‚Äôs a little over $9 billion of unsecured debt, $2\n",
      "billion of bank lines which are due in April, and about $1.5 billion of\n",
      "manufacturer purchase commitments in our rail and aerospace segments. While\n",
      "we‚Äôd like to get back to the unsecured markets along with a lot of other\n",
      "companies, obviously our 12 month liquidity plan assumes we do not have such\n",
      "access. So let me walk you through in general terms what our plan is.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had about $4.5 billion of cash at the end of September, we have an\n",
      "additional $1.7 billion of capacity under the Goldman facility, and we‚Äôre\n",
      "working on finalizing the Wells facility for $500 million. We also expect to\n",
      "do $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in additional secured or securitization\n",
      "financing. We expect the $1.5 billion in aircraft purchases to be financed by\n",
      "the ECA facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally we see portfolio decline particularly our non-bank portfolio by\n",
      "$5+ billion as we book loans through the Utah bank, we reduce non-bank\n",
      "origination volumes including certain asset sales. Utah bank which has over $1\n",
      "billion of cash today as I said will grow about $500 million per quarter and\n",
      "that‚Äôs where the portfolio growth on the commercial finance side will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said all that, there are other things we are actively working on. Jeff\n",
      "mentioned some of them. None of the ideas in progress are in our base funding\n",
      "plan. We do anticipate continuing our opportunistic debt buy-back programs\n",
      "primarily in the front end of our liquidity run rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So our liquidity objectives are clear. Jeff mentioned we want to have enough\n",
      "liquidity to meet the next 12 months or more of unsecured debt obligations or\n",
      "debt obligations and we do that on a rolling basis. We disclosed to you our 12\n",
      "month view. We also target maintaining a relatively robust cash position of\n",
      "over $3 billion as we do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we‚Äôve been successful in managing both sides of the balance sheet. Our\n",
      "review of collections, disbursement and originations is stronger every day.\n",
      "Our ability to uncover new sources of liquidity has been quite successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The financial results. Let me give you a little color on two of the unusual\n",
      "items that impacted the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the goodwill and intangible charge that Alex mentioned. We have been\n",
      "testing goodwill for impairment quarterly; we‚Äôve said that to you and we put\n",
      "it in our disclosures; primarily given the fact that our stock has been\n",
      "trading below book value. The tests are calculated at the segment level and it\n",
      "compares book value including goodwill and equity to estimated fair values\n",
      "based upon market data. We‚Äôve looked at discounted cash flows, tier earnings\n",
      "multiples and price-to-book ratios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the expectation for lower vendor earnings performance as we restructure\n",
      "it and the general reduction in market valuations for financials, the analysis\n",
      "indicated that the vendor finance goodwill and most of the related intangibles\n",
      "were impaired.\n",

      "Secondly, we did have and did report a reserve of $18 million related to our\n",
      "investment of some of our overnight money in the reserve primary money market\n",
      "fund, which as you know broke the buck in late September in the wake of\n",
      "Lehman‚Äôs bankruptcy. We put our redemption request and received confirmation\n",
      "at a 97% payout. Thus, the 3% charge this quarter. But we have not received a\n",
      "distribution and we closely monitor the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "While on Lehman, I should also give you our remaining exposure. Our remaining\n",
      "exposure is essentially relating to derivative transactions in which we were\n",
      "in the money. We had a receivable. The derivatives were terminated on Lehman‚Äôs\n",
      "filing and CIT now has a $33 million claim against one of the bankrupt\n",
      "subsidiaries. Right now it‚Äôs early to predict the specific outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of financial metrics, margins went down about 14 basis points\n",
      "sequentially. The majority came from higher cost of funds. For example, $1.5\n",
      "billion of unsecured debt that matured in the quarter had a cost of LIBOR +\n",
      "25. Those were the good old days about a year ago. $1.3 billion of advances\n",
      "refinanced them under the Goldman facility at LIBOR + 285. That‚Äôs the market\n",
      "we‚Äôre in today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also contributing to the margin decline were increased costs to fund the\n",
      "conduit receivables, somewhat higher nonaccruals and slightly lower rentals in\n",
      "rail. As we look forward we see some headwind as debt is repriced in the\n",
      "current environment. Specifically we‚Äôll ramp up the Goldman facility that we\n",
      "mentioned and the conduits will be in place for the fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the flip side, and you see this in the corporate finance results, pricing\n",
      "on new originations particularly in the lending businesses continues to\n",

      "realize that funding benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fees and other income impacted by the market activity. We did sell or\n",
      "syndicate $400 million of commercial loans in the quarter. We sold the\n",
      "aircraft at a slight gain. Assets held for sale, a metric that many of you\n",
      "have been following and we‚Äôve been on for a year, has declined again to $600\n",

      "commissions were up seasonally but not to last year‚Äôs levels as Alex\n",
      "discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding credit quality, I think Jeff and Alex covered most of that. I was\n",
      "happy to see a decrease in our 60+ delinquency. That did benefit from a large\n",
      "energy account coming current. I think we said we predicted that when we\n",
      "reported our second quarter results, and the foreclosure on the real estate\n",
      "property as that asset gets moved to other assets. Nonperforming assets\n",
      "increased only slightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on that and our loan loss reserve modeling measures, we increased the\n",
      "reserves by $75 million in the quarter, $52 million in commercial and $20+\n",
      "million in consumer. On a year-to-date basis our charge-offs were about 75\n",
      "basis points with 70 basis points or so in the commercial book.\n",
      "\n",
      "On operating expenses, Jeff mentioned we made progress. I was happy to see the\n",
      "progress. We saw the salaries and benefits line start to come down based upon\n",
      "our actions, and year-to-date we‚Äôre down over 10%. We have additional\n",
      "quarterly run rate savings of about $10 million to realize based upon this\n",
      "quarter‚Äôs restructuring but when you put it all together with the\n",
      "restructuring initiatives we‚Äôve put in place, other cost-cutting measures\n",
      "relative to G&A, we are targeting to deliver over $200 million of annualized\n",

      "On taxes, a confusing quarter between continuing discontinued operations and\n",
      "the fact that goodwill is generally not tax deductible. We had an effective\n",

      "operations as we still have not realized or see clear our ability to realize\n",
      "in the near term the home lending NOL. We think that will come in, not this\n",

      "In terms of looking forward we don‚Äôt see a lot of tax expense to book in the\n",

      "are generated, and at this time we expect our effective tax rate going forward\n",
      "on continuing operations to be in the 20% area longer term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally let me close with a few words on balance sheet and ratings.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, ratings. The dialogue with the agencies is very active including\n",
      "treasury discussions with the agencies and senior management meetings. Three\n",
      "of the four agencies rate us A- with the fourth Moody‚Äôs rating us at BBB+.\n",
      "Moody‚Äôs today placed their ratings on negative watch given the continued\n",
      "credit market difficulties. We think our strategy is designed to navigate\n",
      "through this uncertain period which we hope will favorably address forward-\n",
      "looking concerns that the agencies may have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Jeff went through this but I think it‚Äôs important to note. Our\n",
      "balance sheet remains strong, we have a strong cash position, we increased\n",
      "loss reserves, our capital ratios were not impacted by the goodwill write-\n",
      "down, our capitalization is almost at 9.2%, and we will continue to build the\n",
      "balance sheet strength as we reduce asset levels and return to profitability.\n",

      "Thanks, Bill, and good morning and good afternoon. In the third quarter there\n",
      "were challenges that were specific to Nokia and there has been a great deal of\n",
      "turmoil in the financial markets and it is unclear how this will impact\n",
      "different markets. However, given the challenges margin performance was solid\n",
      "in both devices and services and in NSN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash flow was EUR1.3 billion. Our services and software business continued to\n",
      "progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started to shift great new products in Q3 that will be key to our improved\n",
      "device portfolio in Q4, and beyond. During the third quarter we completed the\n",
      "acquisition of NAVTEQ.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let‚Äôs discuss how we see the market and consumer behavior. The world is\n",
      "made up of many markets, with quite different growth prospects. Many of these\n",
      "markets continue to grow like China, India, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and\n",
      "Africa and Latin America. Nokia is the clear leader in all these regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many consumers in these markets have month to month disposable incomes that\n",
      "have always been subject to volatility and require them to continually\n",
      "prioritize their spending decisions. Last year and earlier this year many\n",
      "consumers in emerging market economies were facing material rising food and\n",
      "energy costs that were clearly reducing their disposable income, but we have\n",
      "seen the commodities cost bubble burst and this is now having a favorable\n",
      "impact on many consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the global commodities indices have declined year-to-date by about\n",
      "the same amount as to world's major equities market. Oil below $80 a barrel\n",
      "and rice prices back to levels that do not make headlines are welcome\n",
      "developments that help consumers the world over and help mitigate consumer\n",
      "economic uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we would be na√Øve if we ignored what is happening in the\n",
      "macroeconomic environment in many markets and we are fully prepared and are\n",
      "acting accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this time of economic uncertainty I like our relative position. Nokia is\n",
      "strong, we have scale. We have one of the best brands in the world. We are\n",
      "generating good cash flow. We have a flexible capital structure and we can\n",
      "make continuing product investments in technology and services, all of which\n",
      "will further differentiate us from the competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, Nokia has benefited and become stronger in times of uncertainty.\n",
      "We have outperformed the competition, and we have been less volatile. I would\n",
      "expect this to be the case again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's take a look at the overall device market and our market share in\n",
      "the third quarter. According to our estimates, the mobile device market was\n",
      "310 million units in Q3, up 3% sequentially, a bit lower than what we have\n",
      "seen in recent years. The forecast that the market will be approximately 1.26\n",
      "billion units in 2008, over 10% growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as we have said in our update last month that weaker consumer confidence\n",
      "in multiple markets has had an impact on the market. We expect a seasonal\n",
      "uptick in the fourth quarter in the device market, but as our guidance\n",
      "implies, slightly muted. According to our estimates, our device market share\n",
      "was 38% in Q3, down as we indicated it would be in our update last month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, some competitors have been more price-aggressive recently in an\n",
      "effort to either clear stock or try to gain badly needed scale. We have not\n",
      "broadly participated in what we believe to be unsustainable price moves by\n",
      "certain competitors. However, we do not intend to give the competition a free\n",
      "ride, and economic gravity will apply to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our smartphone volumes were up sequentially in the third quarter, but we\n",
      "estimate we lost share. Our share would have been closer to flat if it was not\n",
      "for the ramp-up problem in the previously mentioned mid-range smartphone.\n",
      "However, with products like Nokia 5800, E71, E66, N79, N85 and N96, our\n",
      "smartphone portfolio is improved and is gaining momentum this quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take a brief look at the number of product and services highlights for\n",
      "the third and the fourth quarter. The Nokia E71 had a great first quarter of\n",
      "sales in Q3, shipping almost 1 million units. The response to the E71 has been\n",
      "overwhelmingly positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first through mass market QWERTY device we have had, and it is the\n",
      "most fully featured QWERTY device on the market. We have seen really positive\n",
      "momentum in e-mail activations with this product both for consumers and for\n",
      "the enterprise. The E71 will continue to be a very competitive and popular\n",
      "product in Q4 and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nokia N96 started shipping in September and did well in its first months.\n",
      "So far, the N96 has been a good addition to our N95 flagship products. The\n",
      "combined volumes of the N95 and N96 products were up sequentially from Q2 to\n",
      "Q3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two weeks ago, we announced our first mass market touchscreen device, the\n",
      "Nokia 5800. It has some great features, high-resolution screen, touch feedback\n",
      "and innovative contacts bar and media bar, browser incorporating Flash,\n",
      "handwriting recognition and Comes With Music for half the price of the iPod.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a growing market for touch-based devices globally. At the right price\n",
      "for the current times, this product has been very positively received by our\n",
      "trade customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see on the slide, we have good offering of new products in our Q4\n",
      "lineup. We feel good about our improved portfolio and our ability to deliver\n",
      "in a seasonally up fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Services and software had EUR115 million of net sales and total billings of\n",
      "EUR140 million. Billings grew 15% sequentially. Navigation has been and\n",
      "continues to be our lead service. Our success in bundling navigation services\n",
      "with our devices continues in Q3. We sold almost 7 million GPS-enabled\n",
      "devices, up over 50% from Q2 and the bundled navigation now on over 70% of\n",
      "those.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to boil down both our opportunity and advantage in services, it is\n",
      "the ability for us to sell services to our large base of users bundled with\n",
      "our industry-leading volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two weeks ago, along with the 5800 touchscreen device launch, we announced a\n",
      "Comes With Music digital entertainment service. Customers who buy a Comes With\n",
      "Music device will be able to enjoy a diverse catalog of music from\n",
      "international and local artists and access to millions of tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comes With Music will be available across a range of Nokia devices, including\n",
      "the new Nokia 5800. The UK will be the first market to offer Comes With Music\n",
      "with sales through Carphone Warehouse. I am also happy to announce today that\n",
      "starting in November; the UK operator 3 will be offering the Nokia N95 8 gig\n",
      "with Comes With Music on an 18-month contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are making real progress in enabling email on our devices to the delight of\n",
      "the consumers. Here are some facts on email. Over half of our devices sold now\n",
      "come with email. We are beta testing our new consumer push email solution,\n",
      "which we plan to rollout commercially soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are continuing to improve the service with frequent releases adding\n",
      "additional languages and all key ISPs. AND in an effort to further advance our\n",
      "efforts in consumer email, a few weeks ago we announced the acquisition of OZ\n",
      "Communications. OZ will provide us a platform for delivering instant email and\n",
      "messaging for the mass market.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to cover the entire spectrum of consumer email, you need two distinct\n",
      "services. One is the full function aritz consumer email for the high-end and\n",
      "the second is for less frequent usage when the cost is the determining\n",
      "competitive factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "For enterprise email, we have had recent success enabling Mail for Exchange on\n",
      "our devices. A lot of companies are warming up to Mail for Exchange. In this\n",
      "environment of potentially over IT budgets, Mail for Exchange is a robust\n",
      "lower cost solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software and services has focused its business. There are lots of\n",
      "opportunities out there but we need to focus our investments on the ones with\n",
      "the credit payback. This focus has led to some impressive OpEx saving while\n",
      "continuing to grow the topline.\n",
      "\n",
      "As so far of this refocusing, we recently announced our plans to consolidate\n",
      "our media and content aggregation services to one single service, cease\n",
      "developing and marketing behind-the-firewall business mobility solutions and\n",
      "sell the enterprise security business.\n",
      "\n",
      "On to Nokia Siemens Networks; during the third quarter, Nokia Siemens Networks\n",
      "continued to show good broadcast. NSN's focus has and continues to be on deal\n",
      "discipline, margin expansion and cash generation. The impact of the synergy\n",

      "**Rick Simonson**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Olli-Pekka. Looking at overall Nokia, I would like to highlight at\n",
      "gross margin performance. In quarter three, Nokia's non-IFRS gross margin was\n",
      "35.7%, up 100 basis points sequentially. This captures the extent to which\n",
      "Nokia is a variable cost business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our gross margins improved even as we shipped fewer devices than we expected\n",
      "during the third quarter. We are able to deliver solid margins because of our\n",
      "market position, cost advantage and a world class supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our gross margins also reflect our strong IPR position. The impact of the\n",
      "licensing into agreements we announced with Qualcomm and certain other\n",
      "companies were slightly positive to our quarter three gross margins. It will\n",
      "continue to provide us with a comparative advantage over the next years and\n",
      "many to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "We achieved our objectives with the Qualcomm deal. Nokia has an active,\n",
      "revenue generating pass license program that provides us increasing revenue.\n",
      "Huawei is the 35th company to join Nokia Cellular standards licensing program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our IPR strength is a key competitive differentiator and we believe there are\n",
      "many opportunities for us to collect the royalties from traditional and new\n",
      "industry players. We have stepped up our efforts and you will see more of this\n",
      "in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to Devices and Services, on a reported and constant currency basis,\n",
      "Devices and Services net sales were down 5% sequentially, and year-on-year\n",
      "were down 7% on a reported basis, and 1% on a constant currency basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our services in software revenue in Q3 was EUR115 million, services billings\n",
      "were EUR140 million, up 15% sequentially. We highlighted during the earnings\n",
      "call last quarter that our services and software revenue would be impacted by\n",
      "a greater amount of revenue deferrals, since an increasing amount of our\n",
      "services and delivered over time. For example, a 12-month navigations license\n",
      "is built up, but revenue is recognized ratably over the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also related to Services and Software, at the end of Q3 we announced that we\n",
      "are in advance discussions to sell our enterprise security business. We report\n",
      "enterprise security revenues in services and software revenue. Therefore, if\n",
      "this transaction is completed, our services to software revenue is expected to\n",
      "decrease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember in 2008, enterprise security net sales have been below EUR50 million\n",
      "each quarter, and importantly, all of our recent services and software growth\n",
      "has been coming from outside of this security business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nokia‚Äôs device average selling price in the third quarter was EUR72, down from\n",
      "EUR74 in the second quarter. The lower ASP was primarily due to a higher\n",
      "proportion of lower priced products. The weaker year-on-year dollar caused\n",
      "over 50% of the year-on-year average selling price decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Devices and services gross margin in Q3 was 36.5% up 40 basis points from\n",
      "quarter two. This was good performance, particularly considering the\n",
      "challenges we faced in Q3. We plan to deliver improved product portfolio\n",
      "execution in Q4.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a sequential basis in quarter three, device and services operating expenses\n",
      "was up 2%, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. Devices and\n",
      "services non-IFRS operating margin decreased to 150 basis points sequentially\n",
      "to 18.6% in quarter three, as we were unable to fully offset the lower net\n",
      "sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "On to NAVTEQ, as mentioned, the transaction closed in quarter three, and we\n",
      "are reporting NAVTEQ as a reportable segment. Revenues in Q3 were EUR156\n",
      "million. Non-IFRS operating profit was EUR29 million or 18.5% margin.\n",
      "Important to point out, this business usually has strong fourth quarter\n",
      "seasonality, typically resulting in higher sales and higher operating margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now a few comments; Nokia Siemens Networks, with regard to the financials.\n",
      "From a seasonally strong quarter two, NSN‚Äôs net sales were down 14%\n",
      "sequentially and 5% year-on-year and were down 14% and flat on a constant\n",
      "currency basis. In Q3 NSN's non-IFRS gross margin was 31.2%, down slightly\n",
      "compared to Q2. This was a good performance given the sharp net sales decline\n",
      "in tough industry environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past three quarters NSN has achieved and sustained solid gross margin\n",
      "performance, driven by structural improvements including, better deal\n",
      "discipline, improved mix, a higher proportion of software sales and cost of\n",
      "good sales related synergies. NSN's non-IFRS operating margin was 5.1% in\n",
      "quarter three, down from 6.7% in quarter two. This was due primarily to\n",
      "negative leverage associated with the lower revenues in the seasonally lower\n",
      "Q3.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Olli-Pekka noted the infrastructure market is in a little tough environment\n",
      "and somewhat uncertain. In the face of the challenging market, NSN will\n",
      "continue to focus on profitability and cash, achieving its synergy targets,\n",
      "vigorous cost control, higher margin opportunities in services, solutions and\n",
      "software, and leveraging its large install base.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we are encouraged by the improved profitability shown in Nokia\n",
      "Siemens Networks in a seasonally weak quarter. We believe this confirms NSN\n",
      "has the right strategy and in fact is executing well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning back to Nokia Group, financial income and expense in Q3 was an expense\n",
      "of EUR57 million. This compared to income of EUR3 million in Q2. The lower\n",
      "financial income and expense is primarily due to a combination of our lower\n",
      "cash position and higher debt position as a result from the NAVTEQ\n",
      "acquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have also had lower interest income resulting from Nokia's months ago\n",
      "moving to more liquid and even shorter length securities, reflecting our early\n",
      "move to extreme safety of principle from our normal position of safety and\n",
      "conservatism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going forward, you should expect financial income and expenses to be\n",
      "approximately minus EUR20 to minus EUR30 per quarter, EUR30 million and that\n",
      "is minus EUR20 to EUR30 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let‚Äôs look at some of Nokia‚Äôs balance sheet and cash flow items; first\n",
      "of all on our capital structure. Let me reassure you, we are structuring in a\n",
      "way that we can sustain and execute our operations unencumbered by the current\n",
      "state of the financial market distress. For a long time our philosophy on\n",
      "capital structure has been appropriately conservative and as a result, our\n",
      "liquidity position today is solid. Many others can not say the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a very comfortable level of instant liquidity. Since 2007, we have\n",
      "focused our investments toward shorter duration, higher quality instruments,\n",
      "such as short-dated government securities and high quality liquidity funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "In connection with the NAVTEQ acquisition, we introduced a moderate amount of\n",
      "leverage to our capital structure through the issuance of commercial paper. At\n",
      "the end of quarter three, outstandings were $3.5 billion. Since mid-September,\n",
      "despite extremely challenging market conditions, we have been successfully\n",
      "refinancing our maturing commercial paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the credit market is very tight, it continues to be open for\n",
      "Nokia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our cash and other liquid assets totaled EUR7.2 billion at the end of third\n",
      "quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of a note on working capital for quarter three, inventories were up\n",
      "sequentially in the third quarter for both devices and services and NSN, as\n",
      "both businesses are geared for the seasonally up fourth quarter. I think we\n",
      "can do more to improve our working capital management in both devices and\n",
      "services business and in NSN. This is a high priority as we close the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me make a reminder regarding the Qualcomm settlement. The Qualcomm\n",
      "licensing agreement we entered into in quarter three includes an upfront cash\n",
      "payment in quarter four. The EUR1.7 billion lump sum payment to Qualcomm will\n",
      "be reported in our cash flow statement in quarter four as an operating cash\n",
      "outflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulk of the payment, the reason I say the bulk is remember that some of\n",
      "the payment goes to the historical amount that was due from the time of April\n",
      "7th until we reached the agreement when Qualcomm was not accepting any of our\n",
      "payments towards them. So the bulk of the payment is essentially a prepayment\n",
      "of cost to goods sold and therefore will be expensed in subsequent quarters\n",
      "until the end of the contract period in 2022. As a result, in the future, our\n",
      "cash payments to Qualcomm will be lower than what is expensed in the P&L.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new agreement with Qualcomm has a positive impact to our gross margins. We\n",
      "already saw a benefit to gross margin after we started providing in a\n",
      "significantly lower royalty rate after the old license agreement with Qualcomm\n",
      "expired in the second quarter of 2007. Going forward, we will see a slight\n",
      "additional benefit to gross margins as the settlement was somewhat more\n",
      "favorable than what we were providing for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me give you a quick update on the share buyback. During the third quarter,\n",
      "we used EUR250 million to repurchase 14 million shares. Since 2004, Nokia has\n",
      "reduced its share count by more than 22%. That is more than 1 billion shares.\n",
      "In early August, however, we put our share buyback program on pause. While I\n",
      "continue to view buyback as an efficient means of distributing excess cash,\n",
      "given the current environment, we think it is prudent to conserve and build up\n",
      "cash, and we do not currently plan to buyback stock in the fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In term of dividends, we run our business with the intent to generate strong\n",
      "profits and to pay a dividend. That is business as usual on that front.\n",

      "three areas in which the company's third quarter was noteworthy. We will come\n",
      "back and cover each of these in more depth later in this morning's discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there's our financial performance. Orbital's financial results in the\n",
      "third quarter were solid. Revenue increased to $278 million. Operating income\n",
      "declined to $21 million on about a threefold increase in research and\n",
      "development spending on the Taurus II launch vehicle. Adjusted earnings per\n",
      "share came in at $0.22 in the quarter. Our free cash flow was a very robust\n",
      "$37 million, which boosted the company's ending cash balance to a record $341\n",
      "million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuing the growth trend established early last year, the company's\n",
      "Advanced Space Programs segment again led the way this quarter with nearly a\n",
      "30% revenue increase. This was followed by our Launch Vehicle Segment, which\n",
      "exhibited more than a 10% revenue gain in the quarter. Garrett will give you\n",
      "all the financial details for the third quarter in just a few minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, let's look at the company's operational highlights. The third quarter\n",
      "saw two major space missions being carried out. These consisted of a\n",
      "communications satellite deployment in August and a longrange target rocket\n",
      "launch in September. We also completed two other communications satellites and\n",
      "one scientific spacecraft that are scheduled for launches in the coming\n",
      "months. Beyond that, we delivered three additional launch vehicles for future\n",
      "missions as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead, we expect our nearterm operational activity to include eight or\n",
      "nine satellite and rocket launches that are planned over the next four months.\n",
      "J. R. will discuss these and other matters a little later in the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, let's consider our new business activity. Orbital continued the\n",
      "year's first half new business momentum with approximately $475 million of\n",
      "contract awards and option exercises in the September quarter. This brought\n",
      "our yeartodate new business totals to just under $1.75 billion, setting a new\n",
      "ninemonth record for the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orbital also continued to be active with new business pursuits in the third\n",
      "quarter. Submitted over $600 million worth of proposals on potential contracts\n",
      "in the July to September period. In addition, we are now preparing another\n",
      "$400 million or more of additional bids for delivery later this year. As a\n",
      "result, our outlook remains positive for new orders and contract backlog\n",
      "growth over the next six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I would like to ask Garrett to take you through the financial results\n",
      "from the third quarter and to discuss our financial guidance for 2008 and our\n",
      "preliminary look at 2009. Garrett.\n",

      "I would also like to update you on several strategic initiatives that are very\n",
      "important for Orbital's longerterm growth looking out over the next three to\n",
      "five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, as J. R. noted, the company's Taurus II launch vehicle development\n",
      "program made generally good progress over the last three months. However, we\n",
      "did delay our final engineering reviews by several months, now planning to\n",
      "complete those in January and February instead of November and December, to\n",
      "make sure that the vehicle's technical configuration will be fully up to date\n",
      "by that event.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also increased our estimates for Taurus II research and development\n",
      "spending in 2009 by $10 million to $15 million. This is partially offset by a\n",
      "$3 million to $4 million lower estimate for R&D expenses in the remainder of\n",
      "2008. Overall, the Taurus II program remains on track for its first launches\n",
      "in the second half of 2010 and a ramp up to some four or five launches a year\n",
      "with around $300 million or so in annual revenue potential by 2012 or 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, on a closely related program, our COTS space station cargo delivery\n",
      "spacecraft that we call Cygnus completed several major technical milestones\n",
      "together with NASA in the last three months. These included preliminary design\n",
      "reviews of both the Cygnus pressurized and unpressurized cargo modules as well\n",
      "as its ground processing and launch site operations and facilities. So far,\n",
      "progress by our team of the COTS program has been very good. This has allowed\n",
      "us to keep it on schedule for a demonstration flight to the space station\n",
      "about two years from now in the fourth quarter of 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we are now in the early stage of assessing the business prospects for\n",
      "a new mediumclass geosynchronous communications satellite, including a look at\n",
      "the sales potential, the competitive landscape, and the product development\n",
      "options for such a new spacecraft. Earlier this year, several of our biggest\n",
      "commercial satellite customers asked Orbital to consider developing and\n",
      "offering a GEO communications satellite platform in the 6 to 10kilowatt power\n",
      "range which would extend the company's current product line well above the 2\n",
      "to 5kilowatt power levels provided by our satellites that we build today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a mediumclass satellite, if successfully developed and accepted by\n",
      "customers, could more than double our addressable market from the $600 million\n",
      "to $700 million a year smaller class GEO communications satellite demand that\n",
      "we address today to as much as $1.75 billion to $2 billion in annual spending\n",
      "for combined small and mediumclass GEO satellites in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to caution that Orbital has not yet completed our assessment of the\n",
      "business outlook or the trade studies of technical alternatives for such a\n",
      "satellite, and we may well decide not to pursue it at all. In any case,\n",
      "though, we are taking a careful look at this and we should be in a position to\n",
      "make a go or nogo decision by sometime late this winter or early next spring\n",
      "on this new product program.\n",

      "Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us this\n",
      "morning. We are pleased today to announce very strong financial performance\n",
      "for the third quarter. While Rob, will provide more detail on our financial\n",
      "results and outlook in just a few minutes, I would like to take a moment to\n",
      "highlight just a few key points.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, our financial performance this quarter reflects many of the\n",
      "themes that we have discussed with all of you over the last several quarters.\n",
      "Not only did we exceed expectations in all of the key financial metrics, we\n",
      "are continuing to leverage our diversified healthcare model, capitalizing on\n",
      "our broad global presence and accelerating the pace of R&D spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you saw this morning, adjusted EPS of $0.88 exceeded guidance for the\n",
      "quarter and increased 26% versus last year. Sales growth after adjusting out\n",
      "for FX was 9%. I think it is worth highlighting that our international sales\n",
      "growth was very robust, and again, after adjusting for foreign currency\n",
      "increased 12%, with all of our international regions outside the US growing in\n",
      "double-digits.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that this continues to demonstrate the value and strength of our\n",
      "diversified business model. It reinforces our strategy and illustrates the\n",
      "market potential for further global expansion. Adjusted gross margin was 50.6%\n",
      "and operating income as a percentage of sales was 22%. Importantly, we are\n",
      "achieving this performance while also investing in key marketing and\n",
      "promotional activities, along with R&D programs, that will position us for\n",
      "growth over the longer term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, our company continues to generate healthy cash flow, a tribute to the\n",
      "focus throughout the organization on managing this very important metric. Our\n",
      "financial strength and flexibility provides us with a solid foundation in this\n",
      "uncertain global economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of our key challenges continues to be the COLLEAGUE pump, as you saw in\n",
      "our press release this morning, we recorded a special charge to increase our\n",
      "COLLEAGUE remediation reserves. This charge primarily accounts for increased\n",
      "repair costs and modifications, related to our decision to harmonize the\n",
      "global installed base on a software platform, consistent with our impending\n",
      "510(k) regulatory filing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to be in active dialogue with the FDA relative to additional\n",
      "software modifications, which include the buffer issue that we previously\n",
      "discussed, the submission of our 510(k) and the protocol for executing a\n",
      "comprehensive clinical evaluation of pump enhancements. As always, I would be\n",
      "happy to take any questions that you might have on COLLEAGUE during the Q&A\n",
      "this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before turning the call over to Rob, I like to take just a few minutes to\n",
      "discuss some recent highlights on several new product and R&D initiatives, as\n",
      "we advance our pipeline through both internal development and external\n",
      "collaborations.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, within our regenerative medicine business, we continue to augment our\n",
      "biosurgery portfolio. During the third quarter, we announced a licensing\n",
      "agreement with Innocoll Pharmaceuticals for exclusive US marketing rights for\n",
      "their gentamicin surgical implant. This is the first biodegradable, antibiotic\n",
      "surgical sponge used as an adjunct therapy for prevention and treatment of\n",
      "surgical site infections. This product is already approved and available in 49\n",
      "countries and is currently in two Phase III clinical trials in the United\n",
      "States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also within regenerative medicine, we are advancing programs and achieving\n",
      "milestones with our partners, Kuros Biosurgery AG. This partnership is focused\n",
      "on the development and commercialization of a portfolio of hard and soft\n",
      "tissue repair products. These products will be based on Baxter's fibrin-based\n",
      "biomatrix TISSEEL fibrin sealant, combined with Kuros proprietary biologics\n",
      "and associated binding technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our development partner Kuros is currently enrolling patients in a number of\n",
      "Phase II clinical programs which if successful and confirmed in Phase III\n",
      "trials, will allow us to enter the fast-growing orthobiologic market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, we submitted an IND to the FDA for the evaluation of GAMMAGARD LIQUID,\n",
      "combined with Enhanze, Halozyme's proprietary drug delivery technology that\n",
      "can facilitate the absorption and dispersion of drugs subcutaneously. This\n",
      "will be a 12-month Phase III trial for patients with primary immune\n",
      "deficiency. Subcutaneous administration of GAMMAGARD LIQUID via a single site\n",
      "could allow patients to administer a sufficient dose of IGIV once monthly at\n",
      "home. We expect to begin this trial by the end of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, we initiated a Phase III clinical trial evaluating the use of\n",
      "GAMMAGARD LIQUID for multifocal motor neuropathy or MMN. MMN is a rare\n",
      "neurological disorder characterized by progressive limb weakness, primarily\n",
      "affecting the upper extremities. This trial is a 15-month randomized double-\n",
      "blinded placebo-controlled study involving 40 patients. These are just a few\n",
      "of the initiatives that represent our increasingly robust new product\n",
      "pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "In closing, we believe that Baxter is very well positioned in today's global\n",
      "macroeconomic environment. While we are certainly not without challenges of\n",
      "our own, the progress that we have made over the last several years to improve\n",
      "the quality of our balance sheet and financial performance will yield great\n",
      "benefits in the coming months and years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our company continues to benefit from the power of our diversified healthcare\n",
      "model, with each of the businesses and regions making significant\n",
      "contributions to our overall performance. As I have mentioned in the past,\n",
      "given the medically necessary nature of our products, our strong market\n",
      "positions, further supported by our global branded presence, we are confident\n",
      "in our ability to drive solid operational performance and growth despite the\n",
      "uncertain economic times.\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, I would be happy to take any questions that you might have during\n",
      "the Q&A. In the meantime, let me turn the call over to Rob for a more detailed\n",
      "discussion of our Q3 results and also outlook for the remainder of 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rob Davis**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Bob and good morning, everyone. Before providing our outlook for Q4, I\n",
      "would like to start today by quickly reviewing with you the charges we\n",
      "recorded in the third quarter which are reflected on our GAAP results. Then\n",
      "discuss our adjusted earnings, excluding charges, in both the current and\n",

      "foreign currency, declined 1%. Double-digit international growth continues to\n",
      "be driven by penetration of SUPRANE, our proprietary anesthetic, augmented by\n",

      "\n",
      "Global IV therapy sales totaled $403 million and increased 16%, with currency\n",

      "\n",

      "currency, international PD sales were up approximately 5% and global PD sales\n",

      "\n",
      "To summarize, Renal continues to perform in line with our expectations. Full\n",
      "year 2008, we continue to expect Renal sales, excluding foreign currency, to\n",
      "be approximately flat. This is primarily the result of lower PD growth due to\n",
      "the lost PD tender in Mexico late last year. Adjusting for this, Renal sales\n",
      "growth would be in the mid-single digits, demonstrating continued progress in\n",
      "the core PD franchise across other markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now turning to BioScience. BioScience sales totaled approximately $1.4\n",
      "billion, generating record quarterly growth of 23%. This growth includes 6\n",
      "percentage points of benefit from foreign currency. This performance is the\n",
      "result of accelerating sales across the portfolio, resulting in double-digit\n",
      "increases for all major product categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recombinant sales of $516 million increased 19% or 14% excluding foreign\n",

      "expectations, with ADVATE conversion in Europe at over 90% and US conversion\n",
      "improving to approximately 65%. US recombinant sales were up 7% and\n",
      "international sales increased 30%. The international performance was better\n",
      "than expected, primarily due to timing of orders and the acceleration of\n",
      "tenders in the EMEA region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the Plasma business. In the quarter, plasma protein sales of $338\n",
      "million increased 37% with currency benefiting sales by 11 percentage points.\n",
      "Performance continues to be driven by the ongoing double-digit growth in\n",
      "global demand for plasma proteins and improved pricing. US plasma protein\n",
      "sales increased 7%, while international sales increased 59%. As we discussed\n",
      "last quarter, strong international growth was expected due to a difference\n",
      "year-over-year in the timing of shipments for FEIBA and PD Factor VIII tenders\n",
      "in the Latin American markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antibody therapy sales increased 25% and totaled $307 million with currency\n",
      "benefiting sales by 3 percentage points. Growth was once again driven by\n",
      "conversion to GAMMAGARD LIQUID, pricing improvements, and strong growth in\n",
      "demand. Sales of our Regenerative Medicine business totaled $104 million and\n",
      "increased 27% with currency contributing 6 percentage points of growth. This\n",
      "is the result of growth of our core portfolio of products, TISSEEL, FLOSEAL\n",
      "and COSEAL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, revenues in the other category totaled $89 million and declined 5%.\n",
      "This decline is primarily due to a tough comparison for the vaccines business\n",
      "in the quarter and a decline in lower margin third-party plasma sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, BioScience growth through the first nine months of the year has\n",
      "been both balanced and robust across the entire portfolio. Therefore, we\n",
      "expect BioScience sales, excluding foreign currency to exceed 10% for the full\n",
      "year. This growth is comprised of the following.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, recombinant sales growth in high single digits. Second, we expect\n",
      "plasma protein and antibody therapy sales in total to grow in the mid to high\n",
      "teens, given solid demand and higher prices. Third, we continue to expect\n",
      "growth in our biosurgery business to be in the mid teens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we expect the other category to decline in mid single digits for the\n",
      "year versus our prior year expectation of a double-digit decline. This change\n",
      "is the result of a strong year-to-year performance in the vaccines business,\n",
      "augmented by a benefit from a large tender expected in the fourth quarter. The\n",
      "strong vaccine sales for the year of approximately $450 million will be more\n",
      "than offset by the difficult comparison for BeneFIX, resulting in the mid\n",
      "single digit decline for the category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the rest of the P&L and starting with gross margin. Gross margin in\n",
      "the quarter of 50.6% improved by 60 basis points versus last year. This\n",
      "performance reflected a significant improvement over our expectation for the\n",
      "quarter of flat margins year-over-year, primarily due to timing and mix\n",
      "resulting from better-than-expected sales of higher margin products in the\n",
      "quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margin expansion is the continued result of improved business and product mix,\n",
      "including conversion to ADVATE and GAMMAGARD LIQUID, favorable pricing across\n",
      "multiple businesses, and manufacturing efficiencies. These drivers continue to\n",
      "offset a modest impact from rising raw material costs and a slight negative\n",
      "impact on margin percentage from currency fluctuations. For the fourth\n",
      "quarter, we expect these operational trends to continue, resulting in a gross\n",
      "margin that is slightly higher than Q3 and reflecting continued margin\n",
      "expansion year-over-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to SG&A, SG&A of $681 million in the quarter increased 12% compared to\n",
      "prior year. This growth includes approximately 5 percentage points of growth\n",
      "from foreign currency. SG&A as a percentage of sales is 21.6%, reflecting a 50\n",
      "basis point reduction versus the prior year period.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Bob mentioned earlier, R&D spending of $218 million increased 30%, and as a\n",
      "ratio to sales was almost 7%. Excluding foreign currency, R&D growth was over\n",
      "20%, driven by significant growth in BioScience and double-digit increases in\n",
      "Medication Delivery and Renal. As our results indicate, we continue to invest\n",
      "for the longer term while continuing to meet our short-term objectives. As\n",
      "evidence of this, despite significant growth in R&D, our operating margin for\n",
      "the quarter was 22%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interest expense was $20 million compared to $6 million last year. This\n",
      "increase is primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower\n",
      "interest rates and the settlement of net investment hedges, as well as\n",
      "increased expense on debt issued within the last 12 months. Other expense was\n",
      "$1 million in the quarter, as miscellaneous expenses and minority interest\n",
      "were offset by foreign currency gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I indicated earlier, the tax rate in the quarter was 16.3% and lower than\n",
      "our guidance of 19%. While our underlying effective tax remains at\n",
      "approximately 19%, the lower rate in the quarter was the result of favorable\n",
      "account adjustments due to valuation allowances, which were somewhat offset by\n",
      "tax expense associated with foreign earnings that we plan to repatriate to the\n",
      "US. Net-net, this resulted in a $0.02 benefit for the quarter. Finally, as\n",
      "previously mentioned, EPS of $0.88 represented an increase of 26%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving now to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the quarter totaled\n",
      "$813 million, and for the year, we have generated approximately $1.9 billion\n",
      "in cash flow from operations. This is an improvement of over $300 million\n",
      "versus the prior year. Our total DSO, which ended the quarter at 55.6 days,\n",
      "improved versus last quarter, as 3 days lower than last year. Inventory turns\n",
      "of 2.4 turns were also better than last quarter and last year. Sequentially,\n",
      "BioScience and Renal turns improved, while turns within Medication Delivery\n",
      "remained relatively flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $251 million, compared to $166\n",
      "million in the third quarter last year, as we continue to invest in\n",
      "appropriate capacity across our businesses to support our future growth. I am\n",
      "also pleased to let you know, that during the quarter, we made our last\n",
      "payment of approximately $240 million and we have now completely terminated\n",
      "the net investment hedge liability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, during the quarter, we repurchased 8.5 million shares of common stock\n",
      "for $589 million. So far this year, we have repurchased 24 million shares\n",
      "totaling $1.5 billion. On the net basis, this amounts to repurchases totaling\n",
      "11.2 million shares for $1 billion, in line with our commitment on a net basis\n",
      "for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I am particularly pleased with our ongoing ability to generate strong\n",
      "cash flows. We continue to return significant value to shareholders as a\n",
      "result of our improved financial flexibility, capital allocation discipline,\n",
      "and financial management, while accelerating investments in R&D, both\n",
      "internally and through business development activities that will position us\n",
      "for future growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, before turning to the financial outlook for the remainder of the year,\n",
      "given the recent developments in the financial markets, I would like to share\n",
      "some important points about Baxter. Fortunately, as you know, we have spent a\n",
      "number of years improving the overall profile of our financial performance and\n",
      "strengthening our balance sheet. So we believe we are well-positioned in this\n",
      "uncertain economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to generate strong operating cash flow, which provides the\n",
      "flexibility to fund our operations, without the need to access the short-term\n",
      "debt markets. With significant cash on hand of over $2 billion, both in the US\n",
      "and internationally, along with increased flexibility to repatriate cash as\n",
      "needed, our liquidity position remains very strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have access to the commercial paper market at reasonable rates if needed,\n",
      "and we maintain a backup credit facility with commended lines of credit of\n",
      "$1.5 billion, which does not mature until 2011 and another facility of 300\n",
      "million euros, which does not mature until 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the credit issues currently impacting the financial markets do not\n",
      "pose a meaningful risk to our operations and funding requirements. Given the\n",
      "recent market volatility and drastic movements in currency rates in the last\n",
      "several weeks, I also want to address the ongoing impact of foreign currency.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we have previously indicated, to-date we have seen a modest benefit on our\n",
      "results. While it is somewhat premature to speculate on 2009, given these\n",
      "drastic movements, particularly in the Latin American currencies, which we\n",
      "cannot directly hedge, we could face some foreign currency headwind next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, however, we continue to be confident in our margin expansion\n",
      "opportunities and growth profile, driving results at a minimum, consistent\n",
      "with our long-range objectives, despite the current uncertainties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing an update on\n",
      "our financial outlook for the remainder of 2008. As you saw in the press\n",
      "release this morning, we raised our earnings guidance to $3.35 to $3.37 per\n",
      "share. Our previous earnings guidance was $3.28 to $3.32 per share. For full\n",
      "year 2008, we expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency to\n",
      "be in the 5% to 6% range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign currency for the full year is expected to benefit sales growth by\n",
      "approximately 4 points, with reported sales growth expected to be in the 10%\n",
      "range. For 2008, we expect gross profit to improve year-over-year by\n",
      "approximately 150 basis points, with SG&A growth of approximately 10% and R&D\n",
      "growth of approximately 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this guidance, we expect our operating margin to improve for the year\n",
      "2008, by approximately 100 basis points to nearly 22%. We now expect interest\n",
      "and other expense combined to total approximately $100 million. We expect\n",
      "interest expense to total more than $80 million as a result of exiting net\n",
      "investment hedges, lower interest income, and lower balances of cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we expect our operational tax rate to approximate 19% for the year, due\n",
      "to the discrete items that drove the tax rate lower in Q3 and a modest benefit\n",
      "of approximately $0.01 related to the 2008 R&D tax credit, which will be\n",
      "implanted in the fourth quarter. The full year adjusted tax rate is expected\n",
      "to approximate 18%.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to expect our full year average share count of 635 million to 640\n",
      "million shares and we now expect cash flow from operations to exceed $2.6\n",
      "billion and capital expenditures to approximate $1 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share of $0.88 to $0.90\n",
      "and sales growth, excluding foreign currency of approximately 7%. While we\n",
      "cannot precisely predict currency fluctuations, assuming current rates foreign\n",
      "currency could negatively impact fourth quarter sales by approximately 2\n",
      "points.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, thus far this year, we have achieved or exceeded our financial\n",
      "objectives. While the macroeconomic environment may be more challenging in the\n",
      "coming months and years ahead, given our balanced, diversified product\n",
      "portfolio, global brand and geographic presence, we are confident in our\n",
      "ability to deliver operational growth consistent with our long-range\n",

      "that we believe that our competition is losing market share, the fact that our\n",
      "software DRM business is not shrinking, it is even slightly growing, we think\n",

      "Thanks, Steve. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm sure most of you\n",
      "had a chance to review our earnings release, which was issued earlier this\n",
      "morning, so I'll focus on just the key points.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the third quarter of 2008, Fairchild reported sales of $428.3 million, up\n",
      "2.3% sequentially, and 0.4% higher than the third quarter of 2007. Gross\n",
      "margin was 29.9%, up a 130 basis points from the prior quarter, due to higher\n",
      "factory loadings, cost decreases related to product insourcing, lower material\n",
      "costs, and favorable currency exchange rates in Asia. We also reduced internal\n",
      "inventory by over $7 million during the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "R&D and SG&A expenses were $83.8 million, down $5 million from the prior\n",
      "quarter and better than our original expectations, due to rigorous cost\n",
      "management, reduced equity compensation costs, and a non-recurring credit of\n",
      "approximately $0.5 million. We recorded a $1.8 million charge for\n",
      "restructuring and impairments, primarily related to streamlining of\n",
      "warehousing operations. Net interest and other expenses were $5.4 million in\n",
      "the third quarter, which is a $0.9 million decrease from Q2, primarily due to\n",
      "lower debt balances and one-time fees related to our Q2 debt refinancing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I'd like to review third quarter highlights for our sales and gross margin\n",
      "performance, for each of our product groups. In our PCIA group, total sales\n",
      "decreased slightly from the prior quarter. Strong sequential growth in excess\n",
      "of 14% in power conversion products was offset by mid single-digit declines in\n",
      "automotives and high voltage MOSFETs. Gross margins improved three points\n",
      "relative to Q2, due primarily to better cost leverage from higher factory\n",
      "loadings in the prior quarter. Our MCCC group saw an 8.6% sequential increase\n",
      "in sales, driven by the low voltage, ultra portable, mobile power, Interface,\n",
      "IntelliMAX and signal conditioning product families.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, MCCC gross margins were essentially flat compared to the prior\n",
      "quarter at about 35.2% as internal inventories were significantly reduced\n",
      "throughout the quarter. Standard Product group sales were down 3% and gross\n",
      "margin was up 50 basis points compared to the prior quarter, also due to the\n",
      "higher factory loadings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reviewing our balance sheet; we reduced internal inventories by more than $7\n",
      "million, resulting in a three day decrease from the prior quarter to 72 days.\n",
      "We continue to maintain one of the leanest inventory levels in the industry.\n",
      "DSOs increased about two days to slightly over 42 days. Cash and marketable\n",
      "securities decreased $17 million to $419.3 million in the second quarter,\n",
      "which reflected cash flow from operations of $48.9 million, capital spending\n",
      "of $44.5 million, and net stock purchases of $12 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning now to guidance; we expect fourth quarter revenue to be down 6% to 12%\n",
      "sequentially. At the start of the quarter, we had approximately 88% of the\n",
      "sales guidance booked and scheduled to ship. Order rates were below\n",
      "expectations in September, resulting in a sequentially lower starting backlog\n",
      "position. We expect that gross margins will be approximately flat\n",
      "sequentially, as we offset lower factory loadings, with insourcing cost\n",
      "benefits, and favorable foreign currency and raw material cost trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect to continue to increase our ratio of insourced packaging during Q4,\n",
      "as the majority of our assembly and test production cuts will be on outsourced\n",
      "volumes. We expect R&D and SG&A expenses to be approximately $80 million to\n",
      "$83 million, and net interest and other expenses to be about $6 million to\n",
      "$6.5 million for the fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect the macroeconomic environment to remain challenging over the next\n",
      "six plus months, and therefore we intend to be very disciplined in spending\n",
      "controls and asset management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I will turn the call over to Mark Thompson.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mark Thompson**\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks Mark. Let me start by following up Mark's last point, with a few\n",
      "general comments about how we are proactively managing the business in the\n",
      "current environment. We‚Äôve demonstrated strong supply chain management in the\n",
      "last two cycles, and we are particularly focused on maintaining lean\n",
      "inventories and short lead times in this market.\n",
      "\n",
      "We reduced our internal inventories to their lowest point in two years and\n",
      "close to the lowest point ever at the end of the third quarter. This gives us\n",
      "some cushion to selectively rebuild die inventory in some of our fastest\n",
      "growing new products, as well as some areas that we have depleted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Channel inventory is at the midpoint of our target range, and we continue to\n",
      "ship in to match consumption. Our lead times remain relatively short, which\n",
      "enables us to be responsive to demand changes and opportunities to capture\n",
      "upsides in the quarter. We intend to hold market share in our base line\n",
      "business, while gaining share on our focused applications by accelerating new\n",
      "product design wins.\n",
      "\n",
      "We posted record sales for our latest high frequency voltage regulators,\n",
      "analog switches, analog video filters, and new generation of power conversion\n",
      "solutions for battery chargers. This should allow us to grow at least as fast\n",
      "as our server markets. We are aggressively managing our manufacturing and\n",
      "operating expenses as evidenced by our significant spending reduction in the\n",
      "third quarter. We believe we can maintain and improve on this trend in the\n",
      "fourth quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me summarize our current results. Revenue grew sequentially as we gained\n",
      "share in a number of key customers with our higher value products, but end\n",
      "market demand softened during the quarter, especially in the computing area.\n",
      "Sales of our products in to the industrial end market were also seasonally\n",
      "lower, while sales into the consumer electronics market increased compared to\n",
      "the prior quarter. Our sales into the OEM channel were up 3%, relative to Q2,\n",
      "driven primarily by new product sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "This growth is enabled by offering higher value analog and power management\n",
      "products, coupled with a responsive global supply chain to service fast\n",
      "growing large customers. In the distribution channel, sell-through was up more\n",
      "than 1% sequentially in Q3 and our inventories at the midpoint of our target\n",
      "range. Overall, average product selling price is down between 1% and 2%\n",
      "sequentially, which is within normal expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lead times were in the six to eight week range during the quarter, and we\n",
      "expect to maintain them in this range in the fourth quarter. Advanced wafer\n",
      "fabrication capacity increased by nearly 8% in Q3, as the new 8-inch line in\n",
      "our main analog fab began to ramp. Overall factory utilization improved during\n",
      "the quarter, as we adjusted starts to meet product demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now turning to our product line results. In our MCCC business, we posted\n",
      "strong overall quarter-on-quarter sales growth of close to 9%. In the handset\n",
      "arena, voltage regulation is growing at a compound annual rate of 13%, and our\n",
      "high frequency DC/DC regulators are the most energy efficient available. We\n",
      "believe that our revenue growth for these mobile power products can\n",
      "significantly exceed the overall market growth, as we focus on key industry\n",
      "leading customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the third quarter, we saw our mobile power sales increase 40% sequentially,\n",
      "as we ramped our latest DC/DC regulator products. Other MCCC products with\n",
      "notable sequential revenue growth in the past quarter were IntelliMAX, analog\n",
      "switches and video filters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our PCIA group provides key technologies to both convert and save energy. For\n",
      "the third quarter, sales were essentially flat at $160 million. A key growth\n",
      "area for this business segment is Primary Site Regulation or PSR for low power\n",
      "applications. These are used in small, highly efficient AC to DC converters,\n",
      "like the ones used to charge mobile phones and MP3 players. PSR uses less\n",
      "power and also requires fewer components, and has a smaller form factor than\n",
      "traditional secondary side regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As legislation and economics drives such power adapters toward higher\n",
      "efficiency methods, such as PSR are required and silicon content increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Q3, our PSR sales increased sequentially more than 40%. We also saw greater\n",
      "than 40% quarter-on-quarter sales growth in IGBTs for industrial and\n",
      "automotive applications and power factor correction.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to manage our Standard Products Group, SPG with cost discipline to\n",
      "maximize overall cash generation. For the quarter, revenue decreased about 3%\n",
      "to $94.7 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we are aggressively managing the variables within our direct\n",
      "control to maintain a lean response to the supply chain while reducing\n",
      "expenses. We expect to hold share in our core business while gaining share in\n",
      "our focus applications to enables to grow at or above the market rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we believe our focus on fastest growing wireless mobility and energy\n",
      "efficient markets will drive a solid long-term growth in our business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Fairchild announced two days ago that it filed a new patent\n",
      "infringement lawsuit against Power Integrations. The lawsuit alleges that\n",
      "certain Power Integrations' pulse-width modulation products integrated circuit\n",
      "products infringe one or more claims of three US patents owned by Fairchild's\n",
      "subsidiary System General.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fairchild is seeking monetary damages and injunction preventing the\n",
      "manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or importation of Power Integrations\n",

      "expected, with core brands responding to the investments we have made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q3 net sales increased 6.4%. Excluding the impact of the timing of shipments\n",
      "stemming from the buy in related to the August price increase, sales growth\n",
      "was approximately 4%. This growth was driven by price realization and overall\n",
      "growth in most core brands and new products, partially offset by softness in\n",

      "\n",
      "First let me update you on the U.S. price increase that we announced on August\n",
      "15th. As we stated at the June 17th analyst day in New York and on our second\n",
      "quarter conference call, commodity costs will be a headwind in 2009. As you're\n",
      "all aware, the prices of many of our commodities used in manufacturing our\n",
      "products have increased significantly since our January 2008 price increase.\n",
      "These costs include double-digit increases on cocoa, sweeteners, nuts and\n",
      "energy. As it stands today, commodities peaked in early July, but the prices\n",
      "of all of these inputs are still up significantly since the beginning of the\n",
      "year.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the June 17th analyst day and as we approached the second quarter\n",
      "conference call, the markets were volatile and we did not have fully\n",
      "visibility into our 2009 cost basket. During this time and through mid-August\n",
      "we executed certain commodity hedging strategies that provided increased\n",
      "visibility into our 2009 variable cost profile. These transactions added\n",
      "approximately $12 million or roughly $0.03 per share of cost to our initial\n",
      "estimate of about $100 million increase in 2008 input costs. Given the updated\n",
      "cost profile for next year, a price increase was necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 11% price increase across much of our line averages about 10% on our U.S.\n",
      "business and was effective immediately on August 15th. However, during the\n",
      "four-week period ending September 12th, existing customers were allowed, based\n",
      "on their historic order patterns, to order up to eight weeks of inventory at\n",
      "the previous price if delivery occurred by October 10th. As expected, most of\n",
      "our retail customers purchased product and took delivery during this\n",
      "timeframe. Therefore, we estimate over 2 points of net sales growth in the\n",
      "third quarter was attributable to volume which normally would have shipped in\n",
      "the fourth quarter.\n",

      "It is important to note that we are honoring previously agreed to promotional\n",
      "allowances for customers to achieve their desired promoted price points on all\n",

      "those prior to the price increase. However, outside of these two seasons\n",
      "consumers will see higher everyday and promoted prices. We expect U.S. unit\n",

      "\n",
      "Net sales performance of 6.4% in the quarter was in line with our internal\n",

      "\n",
      "Moving further down the P&L, interest expense for the quarter decreased,\n",

      "\n",
      "Our cost basket in 2009 includes higher commodity costs. In addition, based on\n",

      "Thanks, Bill, for inviting us to the conference. I‚Äôd also like to thank Lazard\n",
      "for the opportunity to present this morning and to help kick off the\n",
      "conference. Welcome to those of you in the audience and participating via\n",
      "webcast.\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm excited to be here today to give you an update on the business and how we\n",
      "intend to drive growth in the months and years to come. In the past year, AMAG\n",
      "has completed a transformation, one that has allowed us to remake our\n",
      "management team, our cost structure, our strategy, our culture, and I think\n",
      "our employees have a renewed sense of purpose for our shareholders and the\n",
      "patients who benefit from the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we begin, let me remind you that I‚Äôll be making some forward looking\n",
      "statements throughout the presentation, and I refer you to our SEC filings,\n",
      "which outline some of the risks associated with our business and those of the\n",
      "industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "This overview provides a good framework for how I‚Äôll spend my time with you\n",
      "today. Our lead product is Feraheme, which is an IV iron replacement therapy\n",
      "that was approved in 2009 for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in\n",
      "patients with chronic kidney disease, or CKD. We have exclusive rights to\n",
      "Feraheme in the U.S. and we‚Äôre marketing the products with our proprietary\n",
      "sales force. We also have a full complement of reimbursement, managed markets,\n",
      "and medical affairs professionals to round out the commercial organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "So after a quick overview of the product, I‚Äôd like to review some of the\n",
      "progress that we‚Äôve made in recent quarters, including the success we‚Äôve had\n",
      "recently internationally with our partner, Takeda, where we‚Äôve just launched\n",
      "the product in several countries. Then I‚Äôll update you on our ongoing\n",
      "development and regulatory activities to expand Feraheme‚Äôs label to include a\n",
      "broader group of iron deficiency anemia, or IDA, patients, and then I‚Äôll close\n",
      "with the financial information and a quick review of our 2012 milestones.\n",
      "\n",
      "So just to touch on our strategy, at AMAG the strategy is to become a\n",
      "profitable, multiproduct specialty pharma company. We‚Äôre going to accomplish\n",
      "this by leveraging our commercial and our financial assets. We have a great\n",
      "building block in Feraheme as you can see, and we‚Äôre building off a much\n",
      "stronger base today than we had at the beginning of 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our commercial infrastructure, which is shown here in dark blue, and the\n",
      "relationships that we have with customers in the hematology-oncology space,\n",
      "and in hospitals, are driving revenue growth here in the U.S. But the next row\n",
      "of building blocks in this slide also depicts our strong balance sheet and a\n",
      "management team that knows how to execute. The layer above describes four\n",
      "distinct growth opportunities for Feraheme, which I‚Äôm going to talk about in\n",
      "detail today.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, continued growth in the current indication for Feraheme in patients\n",
      "with IDA and kidney disease. On a year to date basis, we‚Äôve grown that\n",
      "business by more than 19% over 2011. Second, we plan to expand the label to\n",
      "include other IDA patients. And by doing this, we‚Äôre going to double the\n",
      "market opportunity and the revenue potential for Feraheme. The third area of\n",
      "growth for Feraheme is the IV iron market expansion, which we believe is large\n",
      "and an underserved market. And last, as I just mentioned, the global expansion\n",
      "of Feraheme is underway.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the relationships we‚Äôve built in heme-onc and hospitals with Feraheme are\n",
      "important, as we work to expand the label and for additional products that our\n",
      "current sales force could promote, products that we‚Äôre currently working hard\n",
      "to acquire or end license, and those new assets are depicted at the top of\n",
      "this graphic.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if we look at Feraheme today, we think it‚Äôs well-positioned in the market.\n",
      "The slide shows many of the benefits of Feraheme over some of the older IV\n",
      "iron, but the benefits are simply captured in the title on this slide.\n",
      "Feraheme is as easy as 1-2-3. Physicians can administer 1 gram of iron in 2\n",
      "rapid injections, approximately 3 days apart. The patient‚Äôs hemoglobin rises,\n",
      "their anemia resolves, and most importantly, patients feel better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feraheme has an excellent efficacy and safety profile, and today physicians\n",
      "and patients have confidence because we‚Äôve now dosed over 5,000 treatments\n",
      "since the launch in 2009. And we‚Äôre fortunate to have a sales force that has\n",
      "the largest share of voice in the IV iron market.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now let‚Äôs spend a few minutes jumping into the commercial opportunity and\n",
      "our recent performance. As background, on this slide the pyramid depicts our\n",
      "view of the size of the Feraheme market opportunity in the U.S., and you can\n",
      "see that our current focus, in dark blue at the top, is really just the tip of\n",
      "the iceberg.\n",
      "\n",
      "This dark blue area represents the current annual IV iron market for chronic\n",
      "kidney disease in patients with IDA, which represents about a $200 million\n",
      "sales opportunity. And the light blue is the market expansion opportunity that\n",
      "we have with today‚Äôs label. The light blue layer consists of more than 1.6\n",
      "million patients who have been placed on oral iron therapy, many of whom are\n",
      "struggling or have stopped taking oral iron altogether. And these patients\n",
      "remain anemic, with a significantly impaired quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The green areas I‚Äôll talk about a little bit later. They represent the future\n",
      "opportunity for Feraheme with the broader, all iron deficiency label. So you\n",
      "can see that there‚Äôs plenty of opportunity for AMAG and Feraheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I‚Äôd like to do next is to highlight that the existing referral patterns\n",
      "to heme-onc and hospital outpatient are the same across are the same across\n",
      "the spectrum of anemia management. Most patients who are referred for IV iron\n",
      "are sent to one of these two sites of care, and they represent the largest\n",
      "users of IV iron outside of dialysis. So that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre very important\n",
      "targets for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it‚Äôs very important, both with our current indication as well as the future\n",
      "expansion opportunities, that we continue to establish Feraheme as the\n",
      "preferred IV iron in these sites of care. Let me give you a sense of how we‚Äôre\n",
      "performing relative to prior years and relative to the IV iron market overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "This graph shows provider gram demand with the colors representing the various\n",
      "segments in which we compete, for example heme-onc, hospitals, nephrology\n",
      "clinics, and others. And demand is up nicely from the third quarter of 2011,\n",
      "as demonstrated by the 11% growth compared to the IV iron market growth of 5%\n",
      "over the same period. And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving the increasing share in this\n",
      "market, which is now at about 14%.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we‚Äôre growing faster than the market, with an evolution index of 106, which\n",
      "is simply our growth of 111 divided by the market growth of 105. We think the\n",
      "evolution index is important because it answers the question of are you\n",
      "gaining share from your competitors. And the answer for Feraheme continues to\n",
      "be, yes we are.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we‚Äôre not satisfied with this growth. In fact, this week our sales force\n",
      "has come together for a national sales meeting to roll out the plans for the\n",
      "rest of 2012 and into 2013 to provide for better execution and to continue to\n",
      "deliver meaningful sales growth in the years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me spend a little bit of time on our two largest segments. First, heme-\n",
      "onc. This segment represents 50% of Feraheme total provider demand, and here\n",
      "you can see the gram sales across the first nine months of 2010, 2011, and\n",
      "2012, with the colors noting the gram volumes for each quarter. The line at\n",
      "the top shows our market share for the third quarter of each year, with the\n",
      "share numbers on the right hand side of the graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we‚Äôve had a good deal of success in the heme-onc segment over the last\n",
      "couple of years, and while we continue to grow in this segment, we still\n",
      "believe there‚Äôs room to expand. Today we have about a 26% market share in this\n",
      "segment, and we‚Äôve been continuing to outpace market growth. In this case, our\n",
      "year to date growth in heme-onc is about three times greater than that of the\n",
      "IV iron market, 21% versus 7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we think there remains still plenty of potential. In sites that are not\n",
      "yet familiar with Feraheme, we‚Äôre going to continue to drive access and\n",
      "awareness through our partner GPOs. And in accounts that are already using\n",
      "Feraheme, there‚Äôs opportunity to continue to take share from the competition\n",
      "by educating clinicians about the broad prevalence of CKD in their existing\n",
      "patient populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other key segment is the hospital market, which represents about 40% of\n",
      "Feraheme total provider demand today. It‚Äôs a segment where we have driven\n",
      "strong growth, and its visible by the 34-35% growth rates that you see here,\n",
      "both year to date and for the third quarter versus one year ago. Our\n",
      "performance over the IV iron market growth remains high, with an evolution\n",
      "index here of 124 in the hospital segment. And this has led to an increasing\n",
      "market share of about 8% now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our success in the hospital segment has been driven by the sales team‚Äôs focus\n",
      "and dedication, combined with our success partnering with a select number of\n",
      "large, national hospital networks. This segment has had a longer selling cycle\n",
      "than the heme-onc segment, but the investment of time that we increased\n",
      "earlier this year in 2012 is paying off now, as you can see, with better\n",
      "numbers. And we‚Äôre working to expand our success to other hospital networks\n",
      "and continuing to drive growth in this segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "So to summarize the commercial performance, we think we‚Äôve done a very good\n",
      "job with Feraheme in the U.S., particularly in the last few quarters,\n",
      "reinvigorating growth in the brand after a rather tumultuous first half of the\n",
      "year. We‚Äôve stabilized the organization and now have a right-sized sales\n",
      "force, which is smaller and more efficient than one year ago, but importantly\n",
      "we think it‚Äôs the right size to call on the right physicians, with the right\n",
      "frequency, and now with the right message. We‚Äôve energized the team with a\n",
      "fresh message, and we‚Äôre on track to achieve double digit demand growth\n",
      "throughout 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we announced last week, there‚Äôs going to be four Feraheme clinical data\n",
      "presentations at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December, and\n",
      "these presentations will provide some new data on Feraheme, including efficacy\n",
      "and safety data from the Phase III studies in broad IDA patients. They‚Äôll also\n",
      "include patient-reported outcomes data that I‚Äôll talk about in a few minutes,\n",
      "and we‚Äôll also present results from a study by Mike Auerbach that evaluated a\n",
      "1 g total dose infusion of Feraheme. And looking to 2013, you can see that we\n",
      "have a number of initiatives underway to drive further growth in the brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let‚Äôs move on to Feraheme and some of the other expansion opportunities\n",
      "that I‚Äôve been referring to. As I mentioned earlier, the broad label would\n",
      "immediately double our market opportunity, which represents approximately\n",
      "8,000 g of IV iron today, or about $400 million annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "The broad IDA patient population, in green here, is an area of high unmet\n",
      "medical need: patients that do not tolerate or have failed oral iron, for whom\n",
      "the only treatment option is currently the iron dextrans. These older first-\n",
      "generation dextran products have been around for decades, and often require\n",
      "inconvenient and lengthy dosing schedules, unlike Feraheme. Additionally, they\n",
      "have serious box safety warnings in their labels, which often discourage\n",
      "physicians from moving patients to IV iron from an oral iron.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our SNDA filing for the broader label later this quarter will contain results\n",
      "from two large clinical trials which were successfully completed this year.\n",
      "These two Phase III trials are described on this slide here. The designs of\n",
      "the studies were based on discussions and input from both the U.S. and E.U.\n",
      "regulatory authorities prior to initiating them about three years ago. We‚Äôre\n",
      "on track to submit the SNDA by year‚Äôs end, and given a standard review, we\n",
      "expect to gain approval and potentially launch the product late next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two trials also collected important data about patient-reported\n",
      "outcomes, using rigorous instruments to evaluate initial values and\n",
      "improvements in quality of life, energy, and vitality levels for the patients.\n",
      "And there‚Äôs some pretty exciting data from these studies that I‚Äôd like to\n",
      "share a little bit with you right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this slide shows the results of one measure of patient-reported outcomes,\n",
      "known as the FACIT Fatigue Score. This is a validated instrument consisting of\n",
      "14 questions that the patients answer relative to the energy level and the\n",
      "feeling of fatigue for the patients, both before and after treatment with\n",
      "Feraheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "There‚Äôs two important takeaways from the data. First, these patients\n",
      "experienced dramatic improvements in energy scores with Feraheme by week five,\n",
      "moving from very low to almost the normal population. Our product delivered a\n",
      "clear and statistically significant clinical benefit to these patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the other and perhaps more enlightening part of the data is just how\n",
      "poorly these patients felt at baseline, with fatigue scores that were\n",
      "comparable to those reported in other studies for anemic cancer patients\n",
      "undergoing chemotherapy. So we‚Äôre really surprised to see how poorly these\n",
      "patients actually felt at baseline, and the improvements that Feraheme\n",
      "delivered over the course of the five weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these patients had tried to address their anemia with oral iron, since\n",
      "that was one of the entry criteria, and they had failed. As you can see from\n",
      "this slide, there‚Äôs over 4 million diagnosed patients currently with IDA, and\n",
      "most of these patients have attempted to treat their anemia with oral iron. So\n",
      "this is one of the expansion opportunities I talked about earlier, which is\n",
      "expanding the IV iron market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Market research with physicians shows that at least one third of oral iron\n",
      "patients fail therapy, due to either intolerance or an inability to achieve\n",
      "the intended clinical benefit. While some of these patients are referred for\n",
      "IV iron therapy, still about 80% of these failing patients are told to keep\n",
      "trying. And as you can see, that‚Äôs a large population. More than a million IDA\n",
      "patients, which is shown in green near the bottom of this cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know that most of these patients will never be able to successfully\n",
      "tolerate oral iron, and we now know from the studies I just showed you that\n",
      "many of these patients feel chronically fatigued due to their anemia. And if\n",
      "we can just convert 10% of these patients who have failed, that represents an\n",
      "additional $100 million sales potential for Feraheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let‚Äôs move on now to the fourth growth opportunity for Feraheme,\n",
      "international expansion. Rienso, which is the brand name of the product in\n",
      "Europe, has been approved and launched by Takeda in Canada, the European\n",
      "Union, and Switzerland, among a few other countries. And that brings us a\n",
      "total of now $33 million in milestones for this year, 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our successful international expansion also brings tiered, double digit\n",
      "royalties on sales in Takeda‚Äôs territories. And additional milestone payments\n",
      "will become due upon the broadening of the IDA label in Europe in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "So four significant areas to drive continued Feraheme growth, but we‚Äôre not\n",
      "stopping there. We‚Äôre going to continue to build our commercial portfolio. As\n",
      "you‚Äôve heard us talk about in the past, portfolio expansion is a high priority\n",
      "initiative for AMAG, and we want to leverage the balance sheet that we have\n",
      "today.\n",
      "\n",
      "We‚Äôre currently focused on acquiring small to medium sized marketed products\n",
      "to leverage our current commercial footprint in the heme-onc segment or in\n",
      "hospitals. You can see some of the screening considerations here, and we\n",
      "expect that these products that we acquire and license will produce positive\n",
      "cash flow from day one. We have a dedicated team within the organization who\n",
      "are charged with executing on this initiative, and there are several\n",
      "opportunities under evaluation at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me now spend the remaining time on our recent financial performance. In\n",
      "the past year, we‚Äôve made significant changes to AMAG‚Äôs cost structure and\n",
      "commercial focus, which has translated into some positive financial\n",
      "performance that we‚Äôve reported. Let me start with a discussion of Feraheme\n",
      "product revenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at net U.S. Feraheme product revenues for the recent quarter ended,\n",
      "there was about 4% growth on a GAAP basis, but the product revenues in the\n",
      "third quarter of this year, as well as the third quarter of last year,\n",
      "benefited from changes in our estimated reserves. If you strip out these\n",
      "reserve reversals, the growth of just the U.S. products sold in the quarter\n",
      "was about 12%, and that‚Äôs shown here in dark blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Importantly, we‚Äôve made significant improvements with regard to the pricing\n",
      "trajectory for Feraheme, and we‚Äôve stopped the price erosion that has been\n",
      "taking place since the launch of the product. And let me discuss that now on\n",
      "the next slide here. This slide depicts our net effective price per gram for\n",
      "the last several quarters. And that is the revenue we realize per gram of\n",
      "Feraheme sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "We took a price increase for the first time since launch in the second quarter\n",
      "of this year, and as you can see on this graph, our net effective price per\n",
      "gram hit a low point. But now, we saw in the third quarter the real benefits\n",
      "of that price increase and how it has positively impacted the dollars we\n",
      "realize on each gram of Feraheme sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our objectives for the brand in 2013 and beyond are to continue to drive\n",
      "demand growth and to continue to gradually improve this net effective price\n",
      "per gram so that these factors have a compounding effect on our financial\n",
      "results.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with the discussion of revenues and our pricing complete, let me just spend\n",
      "a minute or two on our expense structure, beginning with cost of goods. We\n",
      "made the decision in 2012 to get out of the drug manufacturing business and to\n",
      "move to a fully outsourced supply chain. It just isn‚Äôt efficient, we believe,\n",
      "to produce our own drug. So with this outsourcing decision, we expect that our\n",
      "cost of goods and our gross margins will significantly improve as a percentage\n",
      "of sales in 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our operating expenses are heading in the right direction, and this year, with\n",
      "the completion of the IDA program, we significantly reduced our R&D expenses.\n",
      "You can see here about 64% compared to prior year. And on the SG&A side, the\n",
      "rightsizing of the field sales force and our G&A infrastructure earlier this\n",
      "year has driven these expenses lower as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The growth we‚Äôre seeing in Feraheme, combined with the streamlined cost\n",
      "structure, has resulted in a 76% reduction in our net loss per share in the\n",
      "third quarter as compared to last year. We‚Äôve made a great deal of progress\n",
      "this year in shoring up our business and the financials, which has put us\n",
      "nearer to our key goal of achieving sustained profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with a quarter left to go in 2012, we recently updated our guidance, which\n",
      "is shown here. We‚Äôve improved the outlook for both revenues and expenses, and\n",
      "we‚Äôre looking forward to delivering on these financial objectives for the\n",
      "balance of 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "We‚Äôve achieved a number of important milestones, and we have a number\n",
      "upcoming, so let me just spend a minute highlighting a few of the upcoming\n",
      "milestones. As I mentioned, we‚Äôll be rolling out new data at the ASH meeting\n",
      "in Atlanta next month, and we‚Äôre on track to submit the SNDA in the U.S. for\n",
      "the broad IDA indication this quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Commercially, we‚Äôll continue to track the progress that we‚Äôve made on\n",
      "Feraheme‚Äôs pricing strategy, and are improving revenue per gram. The\n",
      "international launches of Feraheme and Rienso are underway this quarter, and\n",
      "we‚Äôll recognize our first royalties on product sales from Takeda. And last,\n",
      "we‚Äôve been very busy in the business development area this quarter, and plan\n",
      "to update you as soon as we have meaningful information to share on this\n",
      "front, so stay tuned.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think with that, I‚Äôll close my prepared remarks. I want to thank you for\n",
      "your time and attention, and I look forward to seeing many of you in one-on-\n",
      "one meetings throughout the conference. Thank you.\n",

      "information in this call.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now I would like to introduce the CEO and President of Harley-Davidson, Inc.,\n",
      "Jim Ziemer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**James L. Ziemer**\n",
      "\n",
      "To state the obvious, there‚Äôs no doubt that these are difficult economic times\n",
      "in the U.S. and globally and every business is feeling some impact. Harley-\n",
      "Davidson continues to be fortunate to be operating in the current environment\n",
      "from a position of strength. I can assure you that everyone in the\n",
      "organization is working hard and smart to produce results but we can‚Äôt control\n",
      "external forces at work in the economy and the credit market, earlier\n",
      "underlining causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harley-Davidson is extremely focused on appropriately managing the many\n",
      "aspects of the business that we do control. Let me start off by thanking our\n",
      "employees, our dealers and our suppliers for all their contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I look at our third quarter results and everything that‚Äôs gone on in the\n",
      "markets since the end of September, I believe there are three key factors to\n",
      "keep in mind. First, although the economic turmoil in the U.S. to an\n",
      "increasing extent in the international markets makes this a very tough\n",
      "business environment, we believe we have positioned Harley-Davidson\n",
      "appropriately for current conditions. We are on track with our business plan\n",
      "for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, during these turbulent times in the credit market we‚Äôve been able to\n",
      "maintain Harley-Davidson Financial Services position as a stable, consistent\n",
      "source for financing for dealers and consumers. That‚Äôs been no small feat. I\n",
      "believe it reflects the underlying strength of the HDFS business model as well\n",
      "as the broader stapability of the Motor Company in Harley-Davidson, Inc.\n",
      "\n",
      "And third, while Harley-Davidson‚Äôs business in certain international markets\n",
      "is also under some pressure due to the global economic downturn, we believe\n",
      "that the international markets will continue to play a growing role in the\n",
      "overall picture for Harley-Davidson. Before I turn it over to Tom, let me also\n",
      "reiterate something that you hear me say often. Harley-Davidson has always\n",
      "managed the business for the long term. We will continue to do so. As the\n",
      "company continues to navigate the current business environment, we believe a\n",
      "long term focus is more important than ever before for the brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with that as the background in context, I‚Äôll hand it off to Tom for the\n",
      "financials and I‚Äôll be back a bit later in the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thomas E. Bergmann**\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to take a moment to reiterate Jim‚Äôs comment that while the current\n",
      "economic environment is challenging we continue to take the necessary steps to\n",
      "insure we are maintaining our strong financial position and protecting our\n",
      "premium brand for the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I rode back to Milwaukee from Bend, Oregon, to celebrate the 105th\n",
      "anniversary it occurred to me day after day, mile after mile just how powerful\n",
      "the Harley-Davidson brand really is. Riders from around the world joined our\n",
      "group as we rode towards Milwaukee. Experiencing the Harley-Davidson\n",
      "brotherhood as we pulled into Milwaukee to join thousands of other riders was\n",
      "powerful and emotional. There is no question in my mind that only Harley-\n",
      "Davidson can offer these once-in-a-lifetime experiences and solidify deep\n",
      "emotional connections to a brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here are a few thoughts before jumping into the financial details.\n",
      "Worldwide retail sales and dealer inventory are in line with our expectations.\n",
      "The decision we made back in April to reduce shipments is playing our very\n",
      "well and has proven to be the right course of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, and I‚Äôll be more specific later, HDFS management continues to do a\n",
      "good job managing through a very difficult credit and market capital\n",
      "environment. Year-to-date, HDFS has generated over $100 million of operating\n",
      "income demonstrating that even in these market conditions it has a solid\n",
      "business model. Furthermore, we have put considerable time and energy into\n",
      "developing alternative funding plans for HDFS that give me a high degree of\n",
      "confidence that we‚Äôll have adequate financial flexibility and liquidity to\n",
      "fund HDFS through 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, we are taking a realistic view that the near term global economic\n",
      "environment will be challenging for our business and that the worldwide\n",
      "motorcycle market growth may slow somewhat in the near term. We will continue\n",
      "to make the appropriate decisions to manage through the current environment\n",
      "will continuing to invest in those activities that will strengthen the brand\n",
      "and support our long term growth potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, let me now turn to the third quarter of 2008 results for the\n",
      "motorcycle and related products segment compared to the third quarter of 2007.\n",
      "First let‚Äôs take a look at retail sales. Our 2009 model year product started\n",
      "shipping into all markets during the third quarter. Overall the response has\n",
      "been very positive. Our industry leading touring family features a completely\n",
      "redesigned chassis. Customers are impressed when they experience a new level\n",
      "of comfort and responsiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tri Glide, our new three wheel motorcycle, has also been very strongly\n",
      "received. Many dealers have already taken deposits on their expected annual\n",
      "allotment and dealers tell us demand is high. We believe Tri Glide is meeting\n",
      "the strategic objectives to keep riders riding longer and bringing in new\n",
      "customers who are not comfortable with a traditional two wheel motorcycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feedback on the new V-Rod Muscle has also been very positive. Last week we\n",
      "launched a campaign that will give the new V-Rod Muscle a lot of exposure\n",
      "among the target audience and beyond. It features Sports Illustrated and\n",
      "Victoria‚Äôs Secret model Marisa Miller. So far the campaign is getting a lot of\n",
      "attention and plenty of hits to the behind the scenes video on YouTube. You\n",
      "should check it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now looking at our dealers‚Äô retail performance on a worldwide basis retail\n",
      "sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down 9.6% for the quarter compared\n",
      "to a year ago. Retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the U.S.\n",
      "decreased 15.5% in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in\n",
      "2007. Overall the U.S. 651+cc motorcycle market decreased 3.1% in the third\n",
      "quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand our performance relative to the U.S. heavyweight motorcycle\n",
      "market in the third quarter, you need to keep two factors in mind. One, the\n",
      "Stick It To The Man finance promotion that ran during June and July of last\n",
      "year, making year-over-year comparisons more difficult. And second, the\n",
      "Japanese manufacturers were still busy implementing lower financing offers and\n",
      "more extreme promotional activities than last year. These tactics appeared to\n",
      "drive unit sales in the U.S. industry this quarter, particularly of non-\n",
      "current model year products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The percentage of non-current model year motorcycles sold by Japanese\n",
      "manufacturers was up considerably compared to last year. For example, 50% of\n",
      "one manufacturer‚Äôs sales in the quarter were prior model year motorcycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our international dealers‚Äô growth continued as retail sales increased 11.3% in\n",
      "the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year. This double digit\n",
      "increase was driven by a 12.4% increase in retail sales of Harley-Davidson\n",
      "motorcycles in Canada, a 17.5% increase in the Asia Pacific region, and a\n",
      "41.6% growth in the Latin America region.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Europe region, retail sales were up 2.9%. Now there‚Äôs a lot going on in\n",
      "the European market. While we continued to see weakness in the UK and Spain,\n",
      "we still saw strong performance in many of the remaining European countries\n",
      "including France and Germany. However, during the latter part of the third\n",
      "quarter we did start seeing slowing in a few additional European countries\n",
      "such as Switzerland and Italy.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we remain pleased with the implementation of our international growth\n",
      "strategies and confident that our international growth will continue, we do\n",
      "expect the growth rate to slow as overall global economic conditions\n",
      "deteriorate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now looking at wholesale motorcycle shipments for the quarter, worldwide\n",
      "Harley-Davidson motorcycle shipments were 74,704 units which was a decrease of\n",
      "11,831 units or 13.7% from the third quarter of 2007 and within our shipment\n",
      "guidance of 74,000 to 78,000 units. Domestic shipments of 49,953 units for the\n",
      "quarter were down 24% from the third quarter of 2007. The domestic shipment\n",
      "volume represented 67% of the total volume shipped to worldwide dealers, down\n",
      "from 76% a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "International shipments of 24,751 units were up 19.1% compared to the same\n",
      "quarter last year. International shipments increased to 33% of our total\n",
      "worldwide third quarter shipment volume compared to 24% in the third quarter\n",
      "of 2007. For the full year of 2008, we have narrowed our shipment expectations\n",
      "to between 303,500 and 306,000 from a prior range of 303,500 and 307,500\n",
      "motorcycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we enter the fourth quarter we are pleased that the overall level of\n",
      "inventory in the U.S. dealer network is significantly lower than one year ago,\n",
      "and we believe is appropriate in these uncertain times. However we still have\n",
      "a lot of work to do to improve our U.S. allocations system in order to deliver\n",
      "the right motorcycle to the right dealer at the right time. We are continuing\n",
      "to work with our dealer network to improve this system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our major international markets, we are also comfortable with motorcycle\n",
      "inventory levels. Based on the potential slowdown we expect in some\n",
      "international markets, we will continue to monitor inventory levels closely\n",
      "and be prepared to take action to maintain appropriate inventory levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let‚Äôs turn to mix. Touring volume was 32.1% of total shipments in the\n",
      "third quarter of 2008 compared to 32.9% in 2007. Custom shipment volume,\n",
      "representing our Softail, Dyna and VRSC motorcycles was 45.9% in the third\n",
      "quarter 2008 compared to 45.6% for the third quarter of 2007. And Sportster\n",
      "motorcycle mix was 21.9% of the mix for the third quarter of 2008 compared to\n",
      "21.5% during the third quarter last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going forward, to the extent our customer base changes, we will accommodate\n",
      "their preferences and balance the mix between our motorcycle families\n",
      "according to their needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now turning to revenue, revenue from Harley-Davidson motorcycles was $1.05\n",

      "segment results for the third quarter, let me give you a little more detail\n",
      "around my perspective and opening comments regarding HDFS. Our priority at\n",
      "HDFS during these stormy times is to continue to balance the availability of\n",
      "credit to qualified customers to facilitate the sale of motorcycles while\n",
      "delivering appropriate returns and profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "HDFS is doing well amidst the turmoil in the current market. I have said all\n",
      "year that profitability would be under pressure, but even in this environment\n",
      "HDFS has produced over $100 million of operating income for the first nine\n",
      "months, which is really a reflection of the strength of the business model and\n",
      "the excellent job the team at HDFS is doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing HDFS‚Äôs funding needs and\n",
      "our plans to insure we obtain all the necessary liquidity and financial\n",
      "flexibility we need at HDFS to fund their ongoing operations in the most cost\n",
      "effective manner. In addition to cash on hand at HDFS today, they presently\n",
      "have over $700 million of availability under our $1.9 billion committed credit\n",
      "facility to support their funding needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the fourth quarter of 2008 we are targeting an additional $300 to $500\n",

      "quarter funding needs include the repayment of $400 million of medium term\n",
      "notes that mature in December of this year. Our primary funding task during\n",
      "the fourth quarter is to access the unsecured capital debt market. However,\n",
      "given the unprecedented volatility in the market we have prudently planned\n",
      "several funding alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first alternative is to fund HDFS through the commercial paper market.\n",
      "HDFS has continued to access the commercial paper markets throughout all this\n",
      "volatility and we expect continued access. However, if for whatever reason the\n",
      "commercial paper market would not be available, we have the committed bank\n",
      "credit facility in place that we could utilize if needed. We are also working\n",
      "on establishing an asset back commercial paper facility to supplement our\n",
      "existing unsecured commercial paper program, which we expect will provide us\n",
      "with another funding source.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, these are just backup plans in the event we are not able to access the\n",
      "medium note market during the fourth quarter or early first quarter of 2009.\n",
      "Looking at 2009, we estimate HDFS funding needs to be approximately $1.5\n",
      "billion for the full year. Our primary funding path in 2009 will be a\n",
      "combination of the unsecured term debt and the asset backed securitization\n",
      "market, depending on market conditions. However, if these funding paths are\n",
      "unavailable, we have developed contingency plans that we expect will provide\n",
      "HDFS with the needed liquidity to fund its operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "One such contingency plan is monetizing HDFS‚Äôs wholesale loan portfolio to\n",
      "provide additional liquidity if the need arises. Again, these are only\n",
      "contingency plans at this point. And beyond these contingency plans, other\n",
      "funding alternatives include the utilization of cash from the motorcycle\n",
      "segment, or the Harley-Davidson balance sheet. I emphasize, we do not at this\n",
      "time plan to utilize motor company cash or the Harley-Davidson balance sheet\n",
      "but given the current unprecedented, tumultuous times in the debt capital\n",

      "\n",
      "So to wrap up the funding discussion, I feel as comfortable as possible under\n",
      "the circumstances knowing we have several alternatives and have spent a lot of\n",
      "time and energy developing solid contingency plans in the event conditions\n",
      "worsen in the capital markets. With that, let me now review HDFS‚Äôs financial\n",
      "results for the third quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harley-Davidson Financial Services delivered third quarter operating income of\n",
      "$35.6 million, a decrease of $13.9 million or 28% compared to last year‚Äôs\n",
      "third quarter. This decrease is primarily due to lower securitization income\n",
      "and the write down of finance receivables held for sale to fair value. Lower\n",
      "securitization income resulted from the fact that last year‚Äôs third quarter\n",
      "results benefited from a $782 million securitization transaction which\n",
      "generated a $3.5 million securitization gain, compared to no securitization\n",
      "transaction or corresponding gain in the third quarter of 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "For receivables held for sale, HDFS completes a discounted cash flow analysis\n",
      "each quarter to determine the held value of the held for sale portfolio. The\n",
      "third quarter discounted cash flow analysis resulted in a fair value lower\n",
      "than the carrying value and therefore required a\n",
      "\n",
      "$9.4 million write down. This third quarter write down was primarily due to\n",
      "the significant volatility and widening of credit spreads resulting in higher\n",

      "periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, I would now like to invite Sy to provide his insight on HDFS‚Äôs\n",

      "\n",
      "**Saiyid T. Naqvi**\n",
      "\n",
      "As Tom and Jim both mentioned, at HDFS we have focused on insuring that we\n",
      "successfully navigate through these turbulent waters. Tom outlined the solid\n",
      "funding plan we have in place for HDFS, so I‚Äôm going to spend the next few\n",
      "minutes on our operating results and the actions we are taking to address the\n",
      "current market environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first nine months of 2008, HDFS originated $2.4 billion in retail\n",
      "motorcycle loans compared to $2.6 billion during the first nine months of\n",
      "2007. HDFS‚Äôs retail market share on new motorcycles sold in the U.S. was 54.1%\n",
      "for the first nine months of 2008 compared to 56.3% in the prior year period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now if you exclude the impact of the Stick It To The Man promotion that ran\n",
      "during June and July of 2007, HDFS‚Äôs market share actually increased by a\n",
      "little over 1%. As Tom mentioned we continue to balance the need to provide\n",
      "credit to qualified customers to facilitate the sales of motorcycles with the\n",
      "need to maintain appropriate returns and profitability. With this in mind we\n",
      "have taken several actions throughout 2008 to adjust our underwriting\n",
      "standards to today‚Äôs market conditions and we continue to adjust our\n",
      "underwriting criteria as warranted.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the overall quality of our portfolio remains high with\n",
      "approximately 70 to 75% of our portfolio classified as prime, which is\n",
      "consistent with our historical spread between prime and sub-prime. In addition\n",
      "to the underwriting changes we have made, we have also implemented a retail\n",
      "price increase that went into effect in October.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price increase reflects the increase in costs of financing and takes into\n",
      "account the credit risk associated with today‚Äôs economic realities. We feel\n",
      "this increase appropriately balances the inherent trade-off between credit\n",
      "availability to support motorcycle sales and profitability of HDFS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now in terms of credit performance, the 30 plus day delinquency rate for\n",
      "managed retail motorcycle loans was 5.6% compared to 4.9% at the end of the\n",
      "third quarter of 2007. Delinquency rates continue to reflect the financial\n",

      "others in the financial services industry.\n",

      "Analyzed credit losses and managed retail motorcycle loans were 1.97% for the\n",
      "first nine months of 2008 compared to 1.65% for the same period in 2007. The\n",
      "year-over-year increase in losses was driven by a higher incidence of loss,\n",
      "primarily due to the higher year-over-year delinquencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the positive side, improved recovery values on Harley-Davidson motorcycles\n",
      "partially offset the higher incidence of loss. In fact, our recovery level in\n",
      "the third quarter were at levels last seen back in 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continued to improve our loan origination and collections capabilities\n",
      "during the third quarter. Recently we hired a new VP of Operations who has\n",
      "over 20 years of financial services experience. We‚Äôve also added collections\n",
      "staff to reduce the number of accounts for collector and improve the\n",
      "effectiveness of our collections efforts overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally just this week we announced our plan to open an additional\n",
      "collections facility in Chicago land area to mitigate future losses. Overall,\n",
      "HDFS continues to solidify its relationship with the Harley-Davidson dealer\n",
      "network. Even in these difficult economic conditions, HDFS remains committed\n",
      "to providing a full range of financial services to our dealers.\n",

      "Clearly today‚Äôs economic environment remains challenging for HDFS, as it does\n",
      "for most companies in the financial services sector. However, HDFS continues\n",

      "Now I‚Äôll get back to the numbers and review Harley-Davidson, Inc.‚Äôs\n",
      "consolidated financial results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash and marketable securities totaled $504.9 million as of September 28,\n",
      "2008. Cash used by operations was $221.2 million during the first nine months\n",
      "of 2008 compared to $1.37 billion of cash provided during the first nine\n",
      "months of 2007. This decrease in cash flows from operations of $1.59 billion\n",
      "was primarily the result of net proceeds from securitization being $2.02\n",
      "billion less than in the same period in 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the first nine months of 2008, HDFS funded a greater percentage of its\n",
      "business with proceeds from commercial paper and medium term notes than in the\n",
      "same period last year. While HDFS‚Äôs decision to fund more of its business\n",
      "through commercial paper and medium term notes does have an impact on our\n",
      "operating cash flow, it does not impact the overall cash flows of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash flows related to HDFS borrowing activity, which are included in financing\n",
      "cash flows, were $1.44 billion higher in the first nine months of 2008 than in\n",
      "the same period last year. During the first nine months of 2008, depreciation\n",
      "was $154.4 million and capital expenditures were $153.7 million. For the full\n",
      "year of 2008 we continue to expend capital expenditures to be between $235 and\n",
      "$250 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to our share repurchases for the quarter, we‚Äôve said that we would not\n",
      "leverage Harley-Davidson‚Äôs balance sheet to repurchase shares and would only\n",
      "repurchase shares with available free cash flow. During the third quarter we\n",
      "repurchased 2.5 million shares for $100.1 million compared to 9.7 million\n",
      "shares for $509 million during the third quarter of last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the extreme volatility in the credit markets during the last few\n",
      "weeks and in keeping with our conservative management of the balance sheet, we\n",
      "do not plan to repurchase shares during the fourth quarter until HDFS has\n",
      "successfully executed a capital market transaction and obtains additional\n",
      "financial flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of September 28, 2008 there were 232.8 million shares of common stock\n",

      "\n",
      "Our third quarter effective income tax rate was 38.2% compared to 35.5% in the\n",
      "same quarter last year. This increase was due primarily to the nondeductible\n",
      "in process research and development charge for the Ambia Gusta group and the\n",

      "31, 2007.\n",

      "for the quarter were $0.71, a decrease of 33.6% from the year ago period.\n",

      "\n",
      "**James L. Ziemer**\n",
      "\n",
      "As I said in my opening comments, I believe there are three key perspectives\n",
      "to keep in mind when looking at the year so far. First, we believe Harley-\n",
      "Davidson is positioned corporately for the current environment of continued\n",
      "economic difficulties in the U.S. and growing economic problems globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, HDFS remains a stable, consistent source of financing for retail\n",
      "customers and dealers during these turbulent times in the credit market. The\n",
      "priority will be for HDFS to continue to balance the availability of credit to\n",
      "qualified customers while maintaining appropriate returns and profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "And third, while our business in some of the international markets is under\n",
      "increased economic pressure we believe that the international markets will\n",
      "continue to play a growing role in the overall picture for Harley-Davidson.\n",
      "Tom and Sy did the deep dive into HDFS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me share some further thoughts on the current environment on the road\n",
      "ahead both in the U.S. and internationally. Key points of differentiation for\n",
      "Harley-Davidson are the brand and our business model. As the company\n",
      "proactively navigates the current economy, we believe a long term strategic\n",
      "focus is more important than ever. And the key part of that long term focus is\n",
      "maintaining a premium brand position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the year when it became obvious that the U.S. economy was going\n",
      "nowhere fast, we adjusted by reducing shipments, keeping with my pledge to\n",
      "ship pure Harley-Davidson motorcycles to our dealers worldwide in 2008 and we\n",
      "expect they will sell at retail. We believe the shipment reduction achieves\n",
      "its objective, position the company and the dealer network for the current\n",
      "climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, many U.S. dealers entered the 2009 model year with fewer\n",
      "carryover models. In fact, new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in general are\n",
      "selling at or above MSRP and the used bike prices are stable and continue to\n",
      "rise. In fact some of our dealers feel they are light in inventory, which\n",
      "suggests we may have been somewhat conservative on shipments. It also suggests\n",
      "that the 2009 models have a wide appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of new products, it goes without saying we‚Äôll continue advancing in\n",
      "product development and marketing. New products are one of the most important\n",
      "keys to our future. We‚Äôll also continue to deliver unparalleled customer\n",
      "experiences which are a real strategic advantage for Harley-Davidson. Our\n",
      "105th anniversary celebration in late August was a huge success by just about\n",
      "every account was even bigger and better and drew a larger crowd than the\n",
      "milestone 100th anniversary.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you consider the incredible pressure on the consumers‚Äô discretionary\n",
      "dollars this summer, as well as the uncertainty generated by the economic\n",
      "climate, I believe the tremendous response to this event underscores the great\n",
      "appeal and the drawing power of the Harley-Davidson brand. I believe this\n",
      "bodes well for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure our anniversary sells motorcycles, parts and accessories and general\n",
      "merchandise. But even more important anniversaries are great ways to build\n",
      "excitement and involvement with all that Harley-Davidson experience has to\n",
      "offer. We build the brand and we plant seeds for the future. And when it comes\n",
      "to experiences, the new Harley-Davidson museum opened in the third quarter and\n",
      "it‚Äôs just fantastic. Since I talked about the museum on the last conference\n",
      "call, I won‚Äôt go into detail today other than to say it‚Äôs an unbelievable\n",
      "experience that appeals widely to riders and non-riders alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shifting gears to the international front, our strategic focus on the global\n",
      "markets continues with investments in international markets to drive future\n",
      "growth. Earlier this month, the third authorized Harley-Davidson dealership\n",
      "opened in mainline China. In addition, Taiwan recently joined the Harley-\n",
      "Davidson family of international markets. And we continue to pursue ways to\n",
      "enter the India market, to cite just a few examples of where Harley-Davidson\n",
      "is headed in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course our acquisition of Ambia Gusta, which we completed in the third\n",
      "quarter, is a prime example of our global strategy in action. This acquisition\n",
      "expands our presence in Europe and deepens our credibility and penetration\n",
      "into performance motorcycles which represent over 70% in the European market.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of the acquisition we stated our first priorities were to put a\n",
      "management team in place, restart production. We‚Äôre off to a great start. With\n",
      "most of the management team in place, headed by Matt [Levetridge], including\n",
      "Claudio [Castibrione], and I‚Äôm also pleased to report that on September 29,\n",
      "Ambia Gusta began producing motorcycles again. Over the coming months, we‚Äôll\n",
      "continue to work on the normalization of production and making progress on the\n",
      "Ambia Gusta product and development front.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we continue to be optimistic about our international growth potential. And\n",
      "we remain confident that international growth for Harley-Davidson will outpace\n",
      "U.S. growth going forward. Let me wrap it up by coming back around to the\n",
      "economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since there‚Äôs no way of knowing when consumer confidence in the economy will\n",
      "rebound, we‚Äôll continue to take what we believe is a measured approach to the\n",
      "marketplace. As always we are carefully monitoring the situation at retail\n",
      "around the globe. To the U.S. economy and consumer confidence starts to\n",
      "rebound or conditions continue to deteriorate further in the U.S. or\n",
      "internationally, we will respond appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout our 105 year history, Harley-Davidson has been through many ups and\n",
      "downs. We are being realistic about the current disruption. At the same time,\n",
      "I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, sooner or later the economy will\n",

      "The tax benefit recognized on the OTTI was based on the treatment of the\n",
      "charge as a capital loss, which limited the tax benefit to Astoria.\n",
      "Subsequently, on October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act was\n",
      "enacted, which includes a provision from permitting banks to recognize OTTI\n",
